Things like your cable box, laptop, and even your speakers may be using almost as much power when they are off but plugged in as when they are on. Group appliances on power strips so you can turn them off at the same time, especially if you’re going on vacation.\n",

That “little” patch of green in front of your home is the U.S.’s most widely grown crop—there are 42 million acres of grass nationwide, more than the total acreage of corn. Lawns require extra water, gas-powered equipment, and fertilizer that pollutes waterways (and homeowners pollute much worse than farmers, since they aren’t versed in professional landscaping). Less grass equals less gas.\n",

            "20. Don’t buy a new home; renovate an old one. Preservationists often say that the greenest home is the one that’s already built. That’s definitely true, but often, older housing stock is less energy efficient, so those seeking to lovingly restore and rehabilitate an old gem end up paying higher heating and cooling costs. The true green home, however, is an old house brought up to speed with 21st-century sustainability solutions. A new project by Harvard’s Center for Green Buildings and Cities seeks to transform an old stick-built home into a model for energy efficiency with an affordable retrofit. Inefficient existing buildings are one of the world’s biggest energy problems; the best place to start making a difference is at home.\n",

In his Rose Garden speech, Trump remarked that he was elected to “represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” In reality, each country is free to choose its own emissions cuts without any sort of enforcement. “Paris is like a vessel, such as a glass – you can pour water or wine into it,” said Sue Biniaz, a former US state department lawyer who drafted parts of the Paris deal. “It’s not the design of Paris that’s the problem, it’s that there’s not the political will to do enough.”\n",

In an often chaotic presidency, Trump’s position on climate change has been unusually consistent – American fossil fuel production must be bolstered, restrictive climate regulations must be scrapped.\n",

            "“There’s been less political will from other countries to take action to a certain extent because the US isn’t pushing for it,” said Biniaz. “During the first four years of Trump it’s easier to say it’s likely to be an aberration, a short-term deviation, but if it’s eight years it’s harder to keep together the coalition of countries that care about this.”\n",

I question, however, resort to expressions that generate more heat than light… It is not good to burden an opinion with “intemperate denunciation of colleagues, violent invective, attributions of bad motives and insinuations of incompetence, negligence, prejudice or obtuseness.”\n",

We need to suppress the friendly fire even within the climate action community. I’ve been in meetings on the Green New Deal where environmental justice groups automatically view all business and industry as evil — and in D.C. conference rooms where well-meaning business people and policy wonks dismiss those environmental justice groups as liberal \"enviro\" fantasists.\n",

            "In 2001’s Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, the trucking industry argued that the EPA should consider implementation costs when setting pollution limits.

In the case of the virus, the danger is the number of infected people overwhelming health care systems; with climate change, it is that emissions growth will overwhelm our ability to manage consequences such as droughts, floods, wildfires, and other extreme events, she said.\n",

            "With entire nations all but shutting down in hopes of slowing the viral spread, “the public is coming to understand that in that kind of situation you have to act in a way that looks disproportionate to what the current reality is, because you have to react to where that exponential growth will take you,” she said. “You look out the window and it doesn’t look like a pandemic, it looks like a nice spring day.

            "And as with the coronavirus, said Wagner, climate policies must push everyone to take heed of the costs their actions — whether disease exposure or carbon emissions — impose on others. “It’s all about somebody else stepping in and forcing us to internalize the externality, which means don’t rely on parents to take their kids out of school, close the school,” he said. “Don’t rely on companies or workers to stay home or tell their people to stay home, force them to do so or pay them to do so, but make sure it happens. And of course that’s the role of government.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Stimulus measures aimed at easing Covid-19’s economic shock could aim to drive emissions reductions too, by funding low-carbon infrastructure or offering online training for green-economy jobs to newly unemployed workers stuck at home, Sawin said. Fatih Birol, director of the International Energy Agency, last week similarly urged governments and international financial institutions to incorporate climate action into their stimulus efforts by funding investment in clean power, battery storage, and carbon capture technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Sawin’s view, the pandemic’s multi-layered impact supports an argument U.S. Green New Deal backers have been making: Tackling our biggest problems in tandem may be more effective than taking them on one at a time. Just as those without sick leave may spread the virus because they must work while infected, unaffordable child care and an employer-based health insurance system can rob people of the flexibility to relocate for jobs in growing industries like clean power, she said. “People are starting to understand that to have a whole society shift behavior really quickly, you need to support everyone,” Sawin said. “A social safety net reduces the friction of change.”\n",

            "Another parallel between the two crises is that we could have headed them off, said Michele Wucker, author of The Gray Rhino: How to Recognize and Act on the Obvious Dangers We Ignore.

            "\n",
            "Wucker said there were political, structural, and psychological reasons for such inaction. “Heading off a risk is risky in and of itself,” she said. “People are afraid of doing the wrong thing,” more than they are of doing nothing. Voters reward politicians for fixing problems, but rarely for preventing them, giving leaders incentive to kick knotty issues down the road.\n",

            "And powerful interests are vested in maintaining the status quo, she pointed out.

            "\n",
            "In the case of Covid-19, while some have sought to deny the seriousness of the coronavirus, people and governments have mostly been far quicker to appreciate its danger. That may in part be because we are instinctually more frightened of disease than of climate threats that many people struggle to envision, Sawin said.\n",

            "The global response to Covid-19 — a near halt in international aviation, factories closing in China and elsewhere, a panicked scramble to enable remote work — will almost certainly bring a downward blip in carbon emissions.\n",

            "But such changes are likely to be temporary, with emissions from driving, for example, expected to bounce back as soon as people return to workplaces. If many grow fearful of public transportation, commuting’s carbon footprint might even rise further, experts say.\n",

            "But some new behaviors could outlast the pandemic, including carbon-cutting shifts climate activists have sought for years.

            "\n",
            "“The question is what trends were out there that could now happen faster,” she said. At the top of the list, Jaffe believes, is a fall in business travel, as big companies realize video meetings can often accomplish as much as in-person ones.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, she said, the pandemic may hasten a flattening, or even reversal, in the growth of international trade, which began to slow in 2019 because of tensions over tariffs. “Now, of course, it’s really crashing,” Jaffe said. If virus-induced shutdowns or border closings create shortages of drugs, medical equipment, or other essential items, many nations and companies may be anxious to reduce their vulnerability to highly globalized supply networks. “If we shrink supply chains, if countries are going to produce more of their own goods, I think that is structurally going to reduce oil demand” and shrink shipping’s carbon footprint, she said.\n",
            "\n",
            "A shift toward remote working may also be here to stay, said Prithwiraj Choudhury, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. And it doesn’t just mean workers logging on from home in the same city as their company. It offers the freedom to work from anywhere — in a small town with a lower cost of living, for example, or wherever a spouse’s job is, he said. Some companies and organizations have gone completely virtual, abandoning offices altogether.\n",
            "\n",
            "“There’s a lot of latent demand” among workers for such arrangements, and companies may welcome the change as they realize they can save money by maintaining smaller offices, or none at all, Choudhury said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those workplace changes may bring real emission reductions, but Sawin said the pandemic’s most important climate impact could come from people applying the lessons the coronavirus teaches about the urgency of swift action.\n",

            "No one could celebrate a disease spreading so much fear and suffering, Sawin emphasized, but with the losses inflicted by the coronavirus sure to mount, “maybe there’s a kind of honoring of that, to at least take what we learn and put it to good use.”\n",

            "\n",
            "William Moomaw has had a distinguished career as a physical chemist and environmental scientist, helping found the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy at Tufts University’s Fletcher School and serving as lead author on five reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In recent years, Moomaw has turned his attention to working on natural solutions to climate change and has become a leading proponent of what he calls “proforestation” — leaving older and middle-aged forests intact because of their superior carbon-sequestration abilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "While Moomaw lauds intensifying efforts to plant billions of young trees, he says that preserving existing mature forests will have an even more profound effect on slowing global warming in the coming decades, since immature trees sequester far less CO2 than older ones. In an interview with Yale Environment 360, Moomaw explains the benefits of proforestation, discusses the policy changes that would lead to the preservation of existing forests, and sharply criticizes the recent trend of converting forests in the Southeastern U.S. to wood pellets that can be burned to produce electricity in Europe and elsewhere.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The most effective thing that we can do is to allow trees that are already planted, that are already growing, to continue growing to reach their full ecological potential, to store carbon, and develop a forest that has its full complement of environmental services,” said Moomaw. “Cutting trees to burn them is not a way to get there.”\n",
            "\n",
            "William Moomaw: So I began looking at some of the data and some of the papers that had come out recently, and I found that if we managed our forests and grasslands in a different way they could be sequestering twice as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they currently do. One paper found in multi-aged forests around the world of all types, that half of the carbon is stored in the largest one-percent diameter trees. So I began thinking about this, and I realized that the most effective thing that we can do is to allow trees that are already planted, that are already growing, to continue growing to reach their ecological potential, to store carbon, and develop a forest that has its full complement of environmental services.\n",
            "\n",
            "We needed a name for that, so I began thinking about names. I actually sat down and went to Google and searched for prefixes, found a whole bunch of them, and the one that I settled on was pro. Proforestation. It’s not that we shouldn’t do afforestation [planting new trees] and we shouldn’t do reforestation. We should. But recognize that their contribution will be farther in the future, which is important. But in order to meet our climate goals, we have to have greater sequestration by natural systems now. So that entails protecting the carbon stocks that we already have in forests, or at least a large enough fraction of them that they matter. We have to protect wetlands, which are actually storing an amount of carbon in the United States that equals what’s in our standing forests. We need to protect and improve the carbon sequestration by agricultural soils and grazing lands.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s taken a very long time for people to focus on something besides reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. And to recognize that even though we’re putting almost 11 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere every year, the increase is only 4.7 billion tons. So where is the rest going? It’s going into plants on land and plants in the ocean. And the largest single place that’s removing carbon dioxide [from the atmosphere] on an annual basis is forests. Even what we think of as mature forests are still accumulating carbon because carbon makes up about roughly half of the dry weight of wood, but it is also in the soils. Even older forests continue to accumulate carbon in the soils. In fact there are forests where there’s more carbon in the soils than there is in the standing trees. As trees get older, they absorb more carbon every year, and because they are bigger they store more carbon.\n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve seen a lot of interest lately in planting more trees. And planting trees is great and it makes us all feel good and it’s a wonderful thing to do and we absolutely should be reforesting areas that have been cut. A recent paper talked about how we could plant more than a trillion trees on nearly a billion hectares of land and how much that would do to solve the problem. These are great things to do, but they will not make much of a difference in the next two or three decades because little trees just don’t store much carbon. Letting existing natural forests grow is essential to any climate goal we have.\n",

            "Moomaw: Well, a little over a decade ago, as a result of a rule change in the European Union, they declared bioenergy, like burning wood pellets, to basically be a carbon-neutral and renewable energy source. But bioenergy is more expensive than all the fossil fuels, more expensive than wind and solar, and the industry would not be economically viable without huge subsidies. So the EU, particularly the UK, is giving bioenergy huge subsidies. The UK has reduced their coal use a lot, but their emissions have not been reduced at the same rate as their coal reductions would indicate because a big part of their replacement is from burning wood in the form of wood pellets that primarily come from the Southeastern U.S. The largest coal plant [in the UK], Drax, has converted half of its units to burning wood pellets instead of coal. And there are a bunch of other power plants in the UK that are doing the same thing, and the same thing is happening on the continent. And they claim it’s carbon-neutral.\n",
            "\n",
            "The tragedy in the Southeastern U.S. [where large amounts of wood for biomass burning originates] is it’s the most biodiversity-rich region in North America and has more species of animals and plants than anyplace else. That is being decimated. For pellets, wetland, hardwood forests are preferable to the pines and the pine plantations, which don’t burn as hot, so those wetland hardwood forests are really being gone after. For a long time, the companies made the claim they were only using the residuals, the branches and so on. An NGO down there called Dogwood Alliance documented that that isn’t true. They’re converting whole trees [into pellets].\n",
            "\n",
            "Moomaw: As you may recall, [former U.S. EPA administrator] Scott Pruitt made the declaration that all forest bioenergy was carbon-neutral. [U.S. Senator] Susan Collins of Maine actually introduced an amendment, which is still binding, that states that all federal agencies must consider all forest bioenergy from sustainably managed forests to be carbon-neutral. There have been lots of letters by scientists and statements that that is just false.\n",
            "\n",
            "We’ll continue to need and want forestry products — that’s understood. But the attitude in much of the forestry industry is that all forests must be managed by principles that improve forests for timber production. But we have to recognize that there’s a distinction between industrial production forests and natural forests, and we must make clear that natural forests are managed for biodiversity and the full set of ecosystem services that forests provide. And, by the way, which biodiversity are we shortest of? The biodiversity that’s associated with older forests. We hardly have any older forests left in the Lower 48 states. It’s in the small single digits of our original forests. The Forest Service says that less than 7 percent of U.S. forests are over 100 years old.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moomaw: Except for the designated federal wilderness areas in national forests, the rest of our forests are almost all devoted to timber production. And as you’ve seen, the Trump administration is now going after the roadless areas, as well. We need to have a conversation about which forests are most capable of sequestering carbon in the near term. And those are forests that are generally in the age range of 70 to 125 years — they are the ones that are going to add the most carbon in the coming decades. Unfortunately, 70 years, for many species, is the perfect size for the sawmill. So it is going to mean saying ,well, we’re going to not cut these. This has to apply to federal and state forests. In Connecticut, there is not a single acre of state forest that is not subject to being cut.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moomaw: That’s right. And that all happened by benign neglect, which worked out in our favor. The [U.S.] Forest Service has just moved into Massachusetts in an alliance with the state and is creating cooperative organizations that will lead to more cutting of this now very carbon-dense, rich forest that we have in this part of New England. The Department of Energy Resources in Massachusetts has put forth proposed changes and regulations that would increase the amount of forests that qualify for subsidies for bioenergy as a renewable resource, as an alternative energy resource. The outcry from the scientific community, the NGO community, and citizens has been enormous. There’s pressure to build a wood-burning electric power generating station in a low income neighborhood in Springfield, Massachusetts. And that’s being pushed back against very hard by the public. But the governor and his team are pushing forward to make it happen, with more subsidies — subsidies that come from our electric bills. That subsidy doesn’t go to solar panels, it goes to burning wood. We’ve got a real problem here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moomaw: I think what you do is you concentrate it on an appropriate set of lands. [Biologist] E.O. Wilson argues that we need “half earth” — that is, half the world needs to be left to nature in order to function. I suppose with one kidney and one lung, we can make it.\n",
            "\n",
            "One policy that I would suggest is that with privately owned forests and relatively small forest plots, people be paid for the ecosystem services of storing carbon and promoting old-growth biodiversity and the resiliency to climate change that these forests provide. We need to compensate private land owners for leaving their forests standing. Not everybody will do it, but that might get us a mechanism where we get closer to our goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other thing — and there’s legislation proposed here in Massachusetts — is that there be no more timber harvesting on state forest lands. We now have a regulatory system that sets aside about 60 percent of forest lands as either parks or reserves. This would say that the remaining state woodlands would become reserves or parks and not harvested. Well, that would mean that 13 percent of the forests in Massachusetts would not be available for timber. The howling has been unbelievable — “This is the end of the world!” And yet, today, the regulatory system is not controlling this adequately at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other thing is there’s a social justice issue here. The plants that make the pellets are all being built in low-income, African American communities that have five times the asthma rate as the state of North Carolina as a whole. These plants produce a tremendous amount of dust and particulate matter. Some of these communities are beginning to fight back. There’s a big push down there politically to deal with this. You know, it’s really amazing how short-term economic interest can dominate social justice, climate outcomes, everything else. So I think one way is to fight fire with fire and turn the subsidies around.

            "LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Can you put a price on pollution? Some of the world’s biggest economies are doing just that as they wrestle with how to make good on grand pledges to tame planet-warming emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "China, Japan and South Korea have all followed the European Union in pledging to cut emissions to “net zero” in recent weeks, where they release only as much as they remove from the air. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden made the same promise in his election campaign.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next year they are set to lay out the first practical measures to meet these targets, as part of commitments under the Paris climate accord, and putting a price on carbon will be front and centre, experts told Reuters.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Each country will have to come up with its own path to reaching net zero, but the expectation is carbon pricing is going to be a very important part,” said Wendy Hughes, Carbon Markets and Innovation Manager at the World Bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "The principle is simple: a carbon price establishes how much companies need to pay for their emissions. The higher the price, the greater the incentive to pollute less and invest in low-carbon technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "Governments can force these payments through a carbon tax - a levy companies must pay when they pollute - or through an emissions-trading system (ETS).\n",
            "\n",
            "An ETS sets a maximum cap on the amount of emissions that a sector, or group of sectors, can produce. It creates “carbon permits” for those emissions, which companies can buy for each tonne of CO2 they emit.\n",
            "\n",
            "More than fifth of global emissions are covered by 46 national carbon-pricing schemes operating today or in the planning stage, as well as 32 regional systems within countries, according to the World Bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the European system was launched in 2005, emissions from participating power plants and factories have dropped by 35% – a sharper drop than seen in sectors not covered by the scheme.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The ETS has proven its efficiency,” said Frans Timmermans, head of EU climate policy. “The ETS shows how carbon pricing is a strong driver for immediate change in energy consumption.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But the trick for these markets is to get the carbon price right. If it’s too low, there’s little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; too high, and risk knee-capping industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "The changes would involve including more sectors, such as shipping, and curbing the free permits given to EU industry to help it compete with overseas companies that don’t pay carbon costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "The carbon price – currently at around 27 euros price per tonne of CO2 - needs to hit levels that push industry toward investing in emissions-cutting technologies like hydrogen, analysts say.\n",

            "“The carbon price has to reach high enough to enable the European Union to reach net zero by 2050,” said Mark Lewis, Chief Sustainability Strategist at BNP Paribas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other major economies are catching on. China, now the world’s top greenhouse gas emitter, plans to launch its own national ETS, possibly as early as next year. That system would become the world’s largest, and is expected to cover several billion tonnes of CO2 from power plants each year.\n",

            "Jos Delbeke, a former senior EU climate policymaker who led the development of the bloc’s trading scheme, said his advice to China had been to build a system that could gradually be reformed over time and could withstand economic shocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The EU learned that lesson after the 2008 financial crisis, when factors including a lack of flexible rules meant the market could not respond to a recession-induced drop in emissions, and became plagued by an oversupply of cheap permits.\n",
            "\n",
            "The price of carbon permits didn’t recover until 2018, when the EU said it would introduce a “market-stability reserve” from 2019 which removed excess permits from the system.\n",

            "“The idea of a global carbon price was built on the assumption there would be dozens of linked trading systems. That hasn’t happened,” said David Hone, chief climate adviser at oil major Shell, which uses an internal carbon price to help meet its own sustainability goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "The lack of global coordination has led the EU to start drafting a carbon border-tax policy - a levy on imports into Europe of polluting goods like steel and cement. The aim is to protect European industry from cheaper imports from regions with lax climate policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Making access to some of the world’s biggest markets conditional on paying a CO2 price should prod countries with weak climate policies “to begin figuring out how they are going to move in a low-carbon direction to remain competitive”, said the World Bank’s Hughes.\n",

And for good reason: There are at least 461 nonprofits in the United States devoted to environmental causes, according to the evaluator Charity Navigator. Not all of them approach climate change effectively, or even do what they claim to. The green-nonprofit world is a thicket, contained in a morass, reachable only by slog.\n",

            "Daniel Stein, an economist who trained at the London School of Economics, learned this lesson about 18 months ago when he went looking for the best ways to maximize his climate giving. “I thought I could find the information after a couple hours of Googling,” he told me last week. “But not only could I not find it, a lot of the information that I could find was straight-up wrong.”\n",
            "\n",
            "So he founded Giving Green, to help people ford the swamp. Giving Green advises people on how to fight climate change with their donations in the most evidence-based way possible. It emerged from beta and published new recommendations last month. Because today is Giving Tuesday—the capstone of America’s ersatz Holy Week and the only square on the calendar devoted to philanthropy—I wanted to look at those recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some background: Giving Green is part of the effective-altruism movement, which tries to answer questions such as “How can someone do the most good?” with scientific rigor. Or at least with econometric rigor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some readers of this newsletter might be familiar with GiveWell, which tries to find charities that save the most lives on a dollar-per-dollar basis. It uses randomized control trials and empirical evidence to identify charities that it says “improve lives the most per dollar.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Giving Green applies this same principle to climate change. It asks: If you donate a dollar to fighting climate change, where will your money go furthest? Right now, it makes recommendations in two areas: carbon offsets and policy change. Each illustrates the benefits of its approach—and the potential problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carbon offsetting should be a perfect fit for Giving Green. There’s nothing theoretically impossible about using money to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet doing so has proved devilishly hard in practice. The field is haunted by an idea called “additionality,” which says that every additional dollar spent on offsets should prevent additional CO₂ pollution. According to the European Union, about 85 percent of carbon-offset projects don’t have additionality. That is, they might prevent some carbon pollution, but the amount of pollution prevented doesn’t reliably match the amount of money spent.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The best way to offset additional carbon pollution is to permanently remove existing carbon pollution from the atmosphere. This is what the Swiss company Climeworks does: It sucks carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid material underground.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the “most certain” way to offset carbon emissions, according to Giving Green; it’s also the most expensive. Climeworks charges more than $1,000 to remove a ton of CO₂ from the atmosphere. For context: If you wanted to offset the carbon dioxide emitted by the average U.S. car each year, you’d be set back $4,600.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is out of reach for most people. So Climeworks offers a subscription service: You can pay the company to capture a small amount of carbon every month in your name. For $8 a month, Climeworks will, over the course of a year, remove 85 kilograms of CO₂—about as much as the average car releases in 210 miles of driving.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. There are cheaper ways to offset carbon pollution. Giving Green also recommends Tradewater, which finds and destroys stores of chemical refrigerants that are more than 10,000 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide is.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because Tradewater targets chemicals that are so much more potent than CO₂, and because it doesn’t need to remove those gases from the atmosphere—it only needs to keep them from reaching the atmosphere—it is much cheaper than Climeworks. At $15 a ton, Tradewater “offers one of the most attractive combinations of price and certainty,” Giving Green says.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Finally, Giving Green recommends BURN, which provides fuel-efficient cookstoves to people in Kenya. BURN requires $10 to prevent a ton of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. (While many of the early hopes for efficient cookstoves haven’t panned out, Giving Green says that the BURN approach is backed by research.)\n",
            "\n",
            "So if you are going to donate $25 to fighting climate change, which of these groups should you give to? None of them, Stein told me. If you want to seriously fight climate change, he said, you need to move beyond buying offsets to supporting “lower-certainty but higher-potential-impact spaces”—specifically, policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Clean Air Task Force works with policy makers in both parties to deploy technologies that could alter the basic math of climate change. Essentially that means it promotes new kinds of nuclear energy, improvements to the power grid, and machines that capture carbon from smokestacks or from the open air. It’s technocratic and nonpartisan.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Sunrise Movement, by contrast, champions the Green New Deal, which calls for massive investment in climate-action and social-welfare programs. Sunrise is one of the most visible activist organizations on the American left, and it’s informally allied with Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and other progressive leaders. So it’s assertively partisan, aiming to help Democrats win elections while compelling their party to recognize climate change as an emergency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Giving Green certifies both organizations as highly effective, but says that donors should choose one or the other based on their theory of how the political system works. If donors believe pragmatic dealmaking gets results, then they should choose the Clean Air Task Force. Giving Green says it has a “long track record of successfully advocating for national-level policy change.” But if donors trust that passionate activism and shifting the terms of national debate will triumph over the long term, then they should go with Sunrise. Though that group is only a few years old, Giving Green says that it “shows promise” and that it has a “strong theory of change and some victories.”\n",
            "\n",
            "(Technically, Giving Green advises that donors give to the Sunrise Movement’s education fund, which is—again, technically—nonpartisan. Because Giving Green is part of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, it cannot support partisan political groups.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Sunrise is certainly the more controversial of the two groups. It has vacillated on the utility of nuclear energy and carbon-removal technology, and it gave President-elect Joe Biden’s climate plan a low grade during the 2020 Democratic primary. (It then endorsed him during the general election.) I asked Stein whether Giving Green’s recommendation might alienate more centrist or conservative donors.\n",
            "\n",
            "“That is unquestionably right,” he said. “Sunrise is associated with policies that are on the left side of the political spectrum … and there’s risk of that, there’s risk of blowback.\n",
            "\n",
            "“But how does change get done?” he continued. “Sometimes it’s bipartisan compromise, but sometimes it’s extremely passionate people on one side.” Many of Sunrise’s tactics are borrowed from the civil-rights movement, he said—a cause that was undeniably effective at changing U.S. policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, Giving Green reveals the value—and the limits—of an evidence-based approach to philanthropy. Jennifer Rubenstein, a political-theory professor at the University of Virginia who has written about effective altruism, told me that she thinks the methodology is good at helping donors avoid the worst 15 percent of nonprofits. Giving Green has likely done so here.\n",
            "\n",
            "But in climate, it faces a harder, even epistemological, question. The carbon-offset question is knowable; some organizations remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere better than others, and it is possible to learn their names. But supporting political action, as Giving Green recommends, goes beyond the realm of quantifiable evidence; it requires arguing about what will change people’s behavior. Sunrise and the Clean Air Task Force are good options for certain kinds of donors. But to support either group is to make a bet about the future. And nobody can run a randomized controlled trial on the future.\n",

We don’t know who will lead the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Energy under Biden, nor do we know who will serve as his domestic-climate-policy chief. (John Kerry will lead climate policy abroad.) But one important name has come into focus: Brian Deese will direct the White House National Economic Council, making him Biden’s top economic adviser.  Deese’s nomination has aroused some controversy. Deese led a White House regulatory office during the Obama administration. But he left to lead environmental efforts at BlackRock, an investment powerhouse that owns a huge share of the U.S. economy, by dint of operating some of the world’s most successful index funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some climate activists argue that BlackRock, by idly owning many fossil-fuel companies, is making global warming worse; progressive activists take issue with its attempt to relax financial regulation. This history led the Sunrise Movement to oppose Deese’s nomination—which, in turn, led Bill McKibben, who has written about climate change since the 1980s and is perhaps the country’s most influential climate activist, to endorse Deese’s nomination.\n",
            "\n",

            "I tell this story not to come down on one side or the other. Instead, I want to call attention to a conflict that will become more common as investment firms become larger players in the climate fight and actively push poorly performing companies to do better. Activists’ skepticism of financial power and the use of that corporate power to accelerate climate action are going to collide.\n",

Yet the Trump administration hasn’t yet publicized the paper that reached these conclusions, The New York Times reports.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Some reasonably good news: Bank of America has announced that it won’t finance any oil exploration or drilling in the Arctic.

            "Risk—identifying, modeling, and managing it—is at the core of the insurance industry. And today there is no greater long-term risk than that posed by climate change. It’s hardly surprising, then, that forward-looking insurers are taking the lead in pushing for climate progress. The industry is in a prime position to catalyze action through both insurer engagement with clients during the underwriting process and the manner in which insurers invest the trillions of dollars in their portfolios.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, any discussion of climate change and business has always included the insurance industry. Until recently, however, much of the conversation has focused on the impact of rising global temperatures on insurance risk. Some $12 trillion to $15 trillion in assets are projected to be at risk from coastal flooding alone, according to the CRO Forum. Less attention has been paid to the flip side—how insurers can actually advance efforts to address the climate challenge. But that is changing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Through our work with some of the leading players in the industry, we have identified four areas in which insurers can take action to advance the battle against climate change:\n",
            "\n",
            "Right now, insurers mobilizing to combat climate change are also confronting the disruption wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many ways, the pandemic is intensifying—not diminishing—the sense of urgency around climate change. A recent BCG survey of 3,000 people in eight countries found that 70% of respondents are more aware now than before COVID-19 that human activity threatens the climate. What’s more, 87% said that companies should integrate environmental concerns into their products, services, and operations to a greater extent than they have in the past. Meanwhile, investors are accelerating their sustainable investing efforts, and companies in many industries are using the disruption of the current crisis as a catalyst to rebuild their business models and supply chains to be greener and more sustainable.\n",
            "\n",
            "In this environment, insurers have an opportunity to redouble their climate change efforts. Those that do so can sharpen their competitive advantage in the market and help society address one of the key challenges of our time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Climate change, driven by rising greenhouse gas emissions, is proceeding at a rapid pace and will create a world that looks very different than it does today. The Global Risks Report 2020, by the World Economic Forum, identified the failure to mitigate climate change as the number-one risk in terms of worldwide potential impact. As that threat comes more clearly into view, insurers are increasingly pushing for action. Insurance industry players, for example, constitute 12 of the 26 members of the United Nations–convened Net-Zero Asset Owners Alliance, a coalition of institutional investors with $4.6 trillion under management that are committed to making their portfolios carbon neutral by 2050.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those insurers understand that climate change has significant, direct impacts on their industry. For example, a warmer planet is already leading to an increase in the frequency of natural disasters and the corresponding claims in certain product lines, with such events projected to rise even further in the decades ahead. In addition, insurers are reassessing their risk models, especially their reliance on historical patterns, given the changing severity and frequency of climate-related events. And a large portion of assets in certain industries will become “stranded”—meaning that they will no longer have value or produce income, particularly if countries around the world adhere to the Paris Agreement. For example, some $1 trillion to $4 trillion in assets in the oil and gas sector are expected to become stranded by 2030, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Such a hit could have significant impact on insurance companies’ financial performance. For one thing, it would translate into lower premiums for the insurers that had underwritten those assets. In addition, if an insurer holds the stocks of companies that own stranded assets, then those holdings could become a drag on investment returns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nevertheless, insurers also have an opportunity to strengthen their business as action related to climate change builds. Those that develop a coherent climate strategy, and apply it across all facets of their business, stand to reap several benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, a sound climate strategy can bolster the underwriting business, such as by spurring the development of new types of insurance and targeting new customers. Global electricity demand, for example, is projected to increase 30% by 2030, spurring $23 trillion in renewable energy investments in emerging markets over the next decade, according to the IFC. The new businesses and assets in those markets will represent a sizable and growing underwriting market for insurers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, evidence is mounting that insurers that factor climate and other ESG issues into decision making are likely to improve their investment performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, insurers that take a leading role on climate, integrating climate risk into their investment processes, will be more competitive in winning third-party investment mandates, especially from institutional investors, such as pension funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fourth, insurers with ambitious climate strategies and transparent disclosure will likely burnish their brands and improve their ability to attract and retain talent.\n",
            "\n",
            "An insurer that wants to develop a coherent climate strategy should articulate a clear ambition for its effort, identify steps to incorporate that ambition into the company’s core business and operations, and make sure that it has the right enablers for success, including strong leadership and engagement, governance, and robust measurement and incentives. (See the exhibit.)\n",
            "\n",
            "A clear ambition for the company’s climate efforts should be presented as a vision or rallying cry for how the company wants to take action on climate change. This should include creating appropriate guardrails to ensure that employee actions across regions and lines of business are consistent, thus maximizing the company’s impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "A clear climate ambition will help leadership identify the actions needed to incorporate that vision throughout their core business. Insurers can advance progress on climate change in multiple areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Underwriting PortfolioInsurers can promote climate progress through their underwriting portfolios in two ways: change the makeup of their customer base or change the composition of their product and service offerings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Drive change in the customer base. To shift the business toward companies with lower carbon footprints, insurers are increasingly using exclusion to remove clients with high greenhouse gas emissions from the underwriting portfolio. Engagement with clients during the underwriting process, on the other hand, can take various forms—such as adjusting premiums or terms and conditions on the basis of a client’s climate action and inviting clients to share their perspectives on climate-related topics. Swiss Re, for example, has used both exclusion and engagement in its underwriting and asset management business. The company announced that, by 2023, it would stop providing insurance and reinsurance to, and investing in, the world’s 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas producers. At the same time, Swiss Re will work with the remaining 90% of producers to support their transitions toward greener energy sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "In some cases, engagement is driven by industry partnerships and coalitions. For example, Swiss Re is also on the advisory board of the Global Maritime Forum, a nonprofit focused on improving the sustainability of the global shipping industry. The Forum is exploring how to drive a shift in the industry away from traditional carbon-based fuels and toward greener alternatives, including green ammonia. One incentive under consideration is to offer lower marine insurance rates to shippers that make the change. Such offers are likely to become commonplace in the future as sustainability is increasingly factored into risk models. Insurance data and analytics provider Concirrus, for example, is integrating a number of new factors, including engine types and the amount of time spent in waters with limits on pollution emissions, into AI-driven ratings models that insurers use to make risk assessment and pricing decisions. Ultimately, the company expects to be able to assess the environmental footprint of every shipping vessel in operation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Insurance players are also trying to attract more customers on the cutting edge of climate action. For example, Munich Re’s Green Tech Solutions business specializes in reinsurance for early-stage green-tech companies, driving greater planning certainty (by making cash flows more predictable) as they bring their technologies to the market.\n",
            "\n",
            "Expand and adjust the suite of offerings. Insurers can also adjust their existing and new product offerings to support climate change progress. Most are creating offerings that promote climate-friendly action, allowing customers to choose to participate. Travelers, for example, offers premium discounts to hybrid car owners and people who own energy-efficient homes, as well as a suite of corporate insurance products for owners of energy-efficient commercial buildings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Less common—but potentially burgeoning—are insurance products that allow policyholders to direct the investment of funds they pay toward premiums or to purchase an annuity. Société Générale and Entelligent, for example, formed a partnership to create a fixed-income annuity product that helps investors direct their capital toward companies that are working to lower their carbon footprints, such as through investments in energy efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Insurance brokers can also adjust their risk solution offerings to reflect challenges created by climate change. Willis Towers Watson, for example, created a solution called Climate Quantified to help companies manage their climate risk. The product fully integrates weather and climate analytical experience, the latest thinking from academia, institutional investor relationships, and risk transfer expertise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Industry collaboration drives new solutions as well. Consider the UN’s Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), for instance, which was founded in 2012. PSI asks participants to disclose their annual progress on its four principles: embedding ESG issues in insurance decision making, raising awareness about ESG factors, managing risk, developing solutions, and working with governments and regulators to promote action. Today, PSI participants collectively underwrite 25% of global industry premiums.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking ahead, insurers should begin to study whether there are correlations between the climate record of companies and their underwriting risks. Other ESG factors, such as health and safety, have long been integrated into insurance company risk analysis. Companies that are successfully reducing their emissions may, in fact, pose better underwriting risks, particularly with regard to policies that have long time horizons. Insurers that understand those correlations may create a competitive advantage in pricing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Investment PortfolioWithin insurance companies, investment decisions are shaped on two levels. The investment office for the company typically sets general principles, while the captive-asset management arm integrates those principles into its investment process. (The principles are also incorporated into asset management agreements with third-party investment firms). When it comes to climate change, insurers have adopted a variety of tactics:\n",
            "\n",
            "Insurers, like other services firms, have relatively small carbon footprints. Greenhouse gas emissions from their internal operations, known as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, are mainly driven by their real estate footprints, utility use, and owned-vehicle fleets. The largest source of insurer emissions typically involves their suppliers, or scope 3 emissions, such as an employee’s share of a flight taken for business travel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, most leading insurers are working to reduce their footprints and are reporting them to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and to ESG data collection firms. MetLife, for example, became the first carbon-neutral insurer in 2016, signaling the importance the firm places on integrating sustainability best practices across its global operations. Companies can take a variety of steps in this area, including retrofitting real estate with energy-efficient upgrades, purchasing renewable energy, converting their fleets to hybrid cars, and adjusting travel policy to reduce frequency.\n",
            "\n",
            "More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted insurers to adopt new ways of engaging with employees and clients, such as by shifting to remote work and expanding the use of virtual tools. Nationwide, for example, has established a permanent shift to remote work for approximately 30% of its total workforce. These workplace changes are causing insurers to rethink how much office space or business travel—both of which significantly contribute to an insurer’s carbon footprint—is really needed. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a real opportunity for insurers to adopt innovative working models that meet the needs of their stakeholders while also bringing down their own internal emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Investors and regulators are requesting a higher degree of transparency and robustness in reporting. The reporting standards are converging, but there remains a proliferation of coalitions and task forces at global, regional, and national levels. There is an opportunity for insurers to take a more active role in shaping the regulatory and reporting standards for the industry. Clearly, there is room for improvement: in a 2019 survey of global investors by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, 59% of respondents felt either somewhat or very dissatisfied regarding the climate-related disclosure for publicly traded companies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Transparent disclosure of climate-related risks is the minimum level of reporting expected today. While not mandatory, the guidance outlined by the TCFD is emerging as a preferred framework for such reporting across industries, with many global insurers releasing TCFD reports annually to highlight their climate-related activity. AXA, an initial cochair of TCFD, was an early champion of increasing climate disclosure transparency and consistency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some regulators are pushing for even more detailed disclosure on both investments and liabilities. The Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, for example, has mandated insurers to pressure test their UK-based investment portfolios under different global-warming scenarios. As China, Japan, the US, and other major markets continue to study the issue of disclosure and potential implications, requirements are likely to become more expansive in the future.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, insurers need strong leadership and engagement. Executive leadership must be out in front on the climate effort in order to maximize the return on investment in climate programs. Insurers can amplify the impact of their climate actions by striking partnerships and joining coalitions as well. A number of insurers have joined prominent coalitions, including in investments (such as the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment), insurance (such as the Insurance Development Forum, the Geneva Association, and PSI), and in the general area of climate action (such as the UN Global Compact).\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, insurers need to create the right governance model. Strong governance includes oversight by representatives across the various components of the business. It also maximizes and coordinates climate-related efforts and holds leaders accountable for their commitments. Allianz Group, for example, has a comprehensive ESG strategy that includes climate and spans the organization’s insurance and investment businesses. To ensure a consistent ESG approach across Allianz, the firm established a dedicated board to strategically define and continuously develop the organization’s ESG ambition and guide its overall approach. ESG activities are integrated across Allianz via group-wide corporate rules on risk management, underwriting, and investment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, insurers must ensure that they are setting clear targets, measuring progress, and creating the right incentives for action. Companies should establish quantifiable KPIs to assess their progress toward climate goals, such as becoming carbon neutral in their own operations or within their investment portfolios, and measure the costs associated with those efforts. And they should look for ways to align employee incentives with the outcomes. Executive performance reviews at Dutch insurer a.s.r., for example, include the assessment of an individual’s progress toward realizing corporate social-responsibility objectives. Among them: achieving 100% carbon-neutral business operations and further developing a distinctive sustainable investing policy position. AXA, meanwhile, integrates company performance on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index into compensation for about 7,000 executives.\n",
            "\n",
            "Insurers have a clear opportunity to become leaders in the climate fight, given their expertise in appreciating and assessing risk. They should move now to create a comprehensive climate strategy that will not only provide clarity for employees, clients, and other key stakeholders but also ensure that the firms are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in the transition and are prepared to withstand business impacts from climate change.\n",

            "But all is not lost. Take it from economist Mark Jaccard of Simon Fraser University in Canada, who has for decades advised governments on climate policy, and who wrote the new book The Citizen's Guide to Climate Success: Overcoming Myths that Hinder Progress. In it, he argues for essential steps we still can and must take to save ourselves and the planet. And he points out that in order to make political changes, scientists and activists don’t have to convince everyone of the seriousness of the threat—they just have to motivate what he calls “climate-sincere” policymakers to put new regulations in place, and fast. With decisive action, he argues, humans eliminated acid rain and ozone-killing chlorofluorocarbons, and we can do it again. But it means confronting persistent myths about climate change. Think of it like the illumination of inconvenient truths within the larger Inconvenient Truth.\n",

            "Jaccard argues against some conventional wisdom, like the idea that fossil fuels are altogether evil, pointing out that almost nothing around you would have been possible without coal, oil, and gas. In response to the argument that we can ditch oil and coal immediately, he points out that renewable technologies are still more expensive and are not as readily available in the economically developing world, where plentiful and cheap fossil fuels are helping pull people out of poverty. And he says the notion of peak oil—the argument that the world’s about to run out of the stuff—is a lot farther off than you imagine, thanks to oil companies finding ever more ways to extract the stuff. Sorry, he argues, but we can’t rely on fossil-fuel scarcity to get us out of this mess.\n",

            "Mark Jaccard: They are really high quality, and they have dramatically improved human well-being. When people in the developing world burn solid fuels in open fires, that is the major killer still today of people in the world from energy-related harm, and it's mostly women and children in poor developing countries. When those places transition to liquid and gaseous fuels—kerosene or propane or butane—the transition in human health is tremendous. Today, it's a huge benefit to people in countries that are trying to develop quickly, whether it's India or Pakistan or Vietnam.\n",
            "\n",
            "People say, oh, renewables are cheaper! And then they'll say, with these international negotiations, we should give money to developing countries so they won't burn coal and oil but will instead do renewables. And then the obvious answer is, wait a minute, you've got an internal contradiction here. If you're telling us that renewables are cheaper, we don't even have to have international negotiations to reduce emissions—the global energy system will naturally evolve to renewables. Which is not true. Where renewables are happening quickly, it's been because of carbon pricing, or even more so, regulations in the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "You also set out to poke holes in the myth of peak oil. That is, we’re going to run out of oil soon, so we’ll have no choice but to rapidly switch to renewables.\n",

And, inevitably, I hear the politician kind of say, well, wait a minute, if the price is going to go really high, then I don't need to do anything. This idea is that either renewables are going to get so cheap—or oil and coal are going to get so expensive—that we will stop using fossil fuels, and that that can solve the problem. Sometimes it's the same people who are concerned about climate change and concerned about running out of energy. And so I'm trying to get them on the same page.\n",

You convinced enough people that got a climate-sincere, or a sulfur-sincere, or whatever-sincere government in place. A quick example here is Ontario phasing out its coal plants; that happened in 10 years. Even if that government had fallen after eight years, the coal plants were already doomed by then.

The 2016 election took place during the United Nation’s annual climate change conference, where advocates, leaders, and scientists had gathered from across the world to hammer out what they thought would be mundane details of the Paris Agreement. The accord had been passed just the year before, after decades of hard work and negotiations, and its implementation already hung by a thread. With Trump, a climate denier who had promised to “cancel” Paris, set to become president, the prospects for continued progress seemed essentially nil.\n",

            "Barnes was right. Brown was in attendance at the U.N.’s next gathering a year later, accompanied by a group of other high-profile mayors and governors who advertised themselves as proof that the United States was still committed to keeping promises on climate, no matter who was in the Oval Office. “The federal government is on holiday with respect to climate change,” Brown told USA Today at the time. But, he added, “there is a large part of America—well over a majority—that is committed to serious climate action, because we know global warming is an existential threat.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Since Trump’s election, states have made progress on climate in the absence of a dedicated federal presence. Over the past four years, for instance, two states and multiple cities and counties have taken fossil fuel companies to court to demand accountability for rising sea levels. States like Pennsylvania and Virginia are gearing up to aggressively cut emissions in the hopes of joining a small but growing cap-and-invest network of Northeastern states (and former member New Jersey reentered the program after voters booted out Chris Christie in 2018). And California passed the nation’s first legislation requiring solar panels on all new homes beginning in 2020.\n",

            "Even as Joe Biden prepares to take office—and his administration publicly promotes an extensive plan for combating climate change—it seems likely that the federal government will partly remain on holiday. Unless Democrats pull off a pair of upsets in Georgia, the Senate will stay under Republican control. And despite shifting public opinion on climate change and renewable energy, the GOP has largely signaled that it will continue to favor fossil fuels and do nothing to curb emissions. So while Biden can (slowly) roll back various Trump administration rules that made it easier for corporations to pollute, the kind of big ambitious climate bill advocates have been demanding for years seems out of reach.\n",

            "Pledges to reach 100 percent renewable energy have become markers of a state’s seriousness to act on climate. When Trump took office, only Hawaii had passed a pledge to reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Today, nearly a dozen states have passed legislation or executive orders that commit them to reaching 100 percent renewables by various future dates. (These commitments have been made far easier by changing market forces: Renewable energy has become increasingly cheap across the world over the past four years.) They’ve also worked to meet those ambitious pledges, making their industries greener bit by bit, regulation by regulation, sharing ideas along the way.\n",

Organizations like the U.S. Climate Alliance have grown to 25 governors (including three Republicans), who say that “states are showing the nation and the world that ambitious climate action is achievable.” International leaders who otherwise might be skittish of the U.S. electing another climate denier in four years have since had the opportunity to work with governors like Brown, whom Barnes said saw “unprecedented” outreach from international leaders following Trump’s election.

            "The other good news is that state-level climate work is going to become significantly easier with a friendly force in Washington. One of the biggest climate actions Biden can take is on emissions from cars, an area where state and federal policy collide. Before Trump took office, California, the nation’s biggest auto market, had formed a coalition of states committed to holding cars to stricter emissions standards than the national rule required. (For consumers, this has the added benefit of raising gas mileage.) After taking power, the Trump administration promptly began an extensive and messy legal battle challenging California’s ability to set its own rules and aiming to tear down the efficiency standards.\n",
            "\n",
            "A Biden presidency, experts say, means that not only will the legal challenge against auto emission standards end—and that these stricter standards are likely to become the rule for the rest of the country—but California and other states can look at similar ways to reduce emissions from other types of engines, like heavy-duty trucks and landscaping equipment. (Lawn mowers might not sound threatening, but emissions from the unregulated landscaping sector are on track to surpass emissions from cars.)\n",

            "“Often, the federal government either collaborates with California or follows California’s lead once the state has shown that its regulations are workable,” said Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at UCLA. “California can’t regulate those small engines or truck engines while battling the federal government.

During his Monday visit to McClellan Park, California, he met with California Gov.

We are experiencing weather conditions the likes of which we've never experienced in our lifetime,\" a visibly agitated Newsom said Friday after surveying burned areas of the North Complex fire. \"This is a climate damn emergency.

            "But Trump's dismissive comments about the climate crisis during the other exchange about its effect on the fires was in keeping with his recent remarks on the topic during other natural disasters. During an emergency operations briefing in Lake Charles, Louisiana, late last month, Trump shrugged off a question about whether storms like Hurricane Laura were becoming more frequent because of climate change: \"Who knows,\" he said, adding that he'd been told the area's biggest storm was in the 1800s. \"There's no way of really understanding that or knowing that.\"\n",

            "Israel announced on Saturday that it is establishing full diplomatic relations with the relatively isolated Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the latest in a string of international deals designed to show Israel’s growing acceptance abroad. “The circle of recognition of Israel is widening,” said Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi. “The establishment of relations with the Kingdom of Bhutan will constitute a new stage in the deepening of Israel’s relations in Asia.” The agreement follows several years of secret contact between the two countries with the aim of establishing relations, according to a statement from Israel’s foreign ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the deal, tweeting that it is an “additional fruit of the peace agreements”. The accord between the two countries does not appear to be linked to the US-backed Abraham accords, in which four Arab countries have agreed to normalise relations with the Jewish state since August. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel was in contact with more countries to normalise relations. Bhutan is a relatively isolated country and only maintains diplomatic relations with around 53 countries, which does not include the US, UK or France, who only maintain informal contact via India. With a population of around 800,000 people, the Kingdom of Bhutan is wedged between neighbouring giants, China and India. They have long relied on the latter for guidance on foreign and defence policy. Ron Malka, the Israeli ambassador to India said he signed the agreement with his Bhutanese counterpart, Maj Gen Vestop Namgyel, on Saturday night, calling the agreement a “historic day”. The joint statement on the deal said the key areas of cooperation would include economic, technological and agricultural development. “The ties between the peoples through cultural exchanges and tourism would also be further enhanced,” the statement added. Bhutan was closed off to tourists until 1970 and still strictly limits entry to the country with a $250 daily fee per visitor in high season\n",

            "CHICAGO (AP) — “Cheer” star Jerry Harris, already facing federal child pornography charges, has been indicted on new charges that allege he solicited sex from minors at cheerleading competitions and convinced teenage boys to send him obscene photographs and videos of themselves.  In the original complaint filed in September, not only did prosecutors allege that Harris admitted to FBI agents to asking a teenage boy to send him lewd photographs of himself, but that he requested on Snapchat child pornography from at least 10 to 15 others he knew to be minors.  Harris, 21, of Naperville, has been held in a federal detention facility without bond since he was arrested on child pornography charges in September, and a judge has subsequently suggested that Harris would pose a public danger if released from custody.\n",

            "Authorities searching for a British woman who went missing while hiking in the Pyrenees are reportedly considering the possibility she has deliberately disappeared because her nomadic lifestyle was about to end. Esther Dingley and Dan Colegate had been travelling throughout Europe since 2014 and she was expected to return from a solo trek on December 2. The 37-year-old set out to hike from the Port de la Glere to the Port de Venasque, a trek which follows the border between France and Spain, according to local police. Captain Jean-Marc Bordinaro of France's Gendarmerie de Saint-Gaudens told The Times: \"Esther Dingley wanted to continue with her current way of life, journeys in a camper van and sporting activities including hiking, whilst Daniel Colegate seems a little tired of this nomadic life.\" He added: \"Did Esther Dingley want to go off on her own to live her life and organise her own disappearance? There is nothing enabling us to eliminate this working theory.\" A spokesman for missing persons charity LBT Global, which is assisting Mr Colegate, told The Times \"there is absolutely no suggestion that (Ms Dingley) was seeking 'another life\"'. Mr Colegate said in a Facebook post on December 1 that the \"prevailing opinion\" of authorities was Ms Dingley was not in the mountains following extensive searches. She is now listed as a national missing person in Spain and her case has been passed to \"a specialised judicial unit in France\", Mr Colegate added. \"As things stand tonight, Esther is now listed as a national missing persons case in Spain and the case has been passed to a specialised judicial unit in France. \"This means they will be looking at other options beyond a mountain accident.\" Mr Colegate said he was \"very grateful\" for the extensive efforts of rescue teams in Spain and France, which had utilised helicopters, dogs and a drone. \"While this is a terrifying development in many ways, I'm trying to focus on the fact that it leaves the door open that Esther might still come home,\" he said in the post. \"She was so utterly happy and joyful when we last spoke, I'd do anything to see her face and hold her right now.\" The couple, from Durham, started to travel after Mr Colegate had a serious health scare, and had been documenting their campervan adventures online. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesman has previously said its staff were \"supporting the family of a British woman reported missing in the Pyrenees and are in contact with the French and Spanish authorities\".\n",

On Friday the Supreme Court ruled against the president, dismissing an effort led by Texas to stop the votes from four swing states counting for Joe Biden. Mr Trump on Sunday morning told Fox News he was \"so disappointed\" by their decision, ending what seemed to be their final throw of the dice. Mr Trump was expected at a Friday night White House Christmas party, but did not appear to greet his guests, The New York Times reported. \"We've proven it [fraud], but no judge has had the courage, including the Supreme Court - I am so disappointed in them,\" said Mr Trump. \"No judge, including in the Supreme Court of the United States, has had the courage to allow it to be heard.\"\n",

            "Tehran summoned the German ambassador on Sunday for \"unacceptable interference in Iran’s internal affairs,\" after the European Union condemned the regime's execution of Ruhollah Zam, a prominent journalist. Mr Zam was executed on Saturday morning after he was convicted in June for “corruption on Earth”, a charge often used in cases involving espionage or attempts to overthrow Iran's government. His website and Telegram channel, AmadNews, had over a million followers and was one of Iran’s most popular online news outlets both inside the Islamic republic and among its diaspora. His anti-corruption work, according to the Iranian authorities, fomented violence during the 2017 anti-government protests. AmadNews spread timings for the protests and leaked embarrassing information about officials that directly challenged Iran’s government. The EU, which no longer has a delegation in Iran, is represented by the rotating member state holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU, which is currently Germany. In a statement after his execution on Saturday, the EU said: “The European Union condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances.” Mr Zam, 47, had been exiled under refugee status in Paris and was reportedly tricked into travelling to Iraq by Iranian authorities last year, where he was then abducted and forced to return to Iran under mysterious circumstances. The French envoy is also expected to be summoned according to the semi-official Fars news agency, for “the meddling of his country’s officials in Iran’s judicial affairs.” \"This is a barbarous and unacceptable act,\" the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement after the execution, which also condemned the hanging as a \"grave blow\" to freedom of speech in Iran.\n",

He stepped up at age 9 to lead the third generation of Earth Guardians, an environmental activist program for kids. By his 12th birthday, he’d spent nearly a decade on the road when depression hit. The touring schedule and indifference of his peers took a toll on his hope that things could change, he says. He didn’t know how to cope with the emotion—until he discovered hip-hop.\n",

Music could move a younger audience, too. The vision hit him at a hip-hop show when he saw the raw, live energy of a young crowd dancing to the music. As a climate activist, he set out to create a new kind of movement, one that was “dripping in art, color and diversity.”\n",

            "The heat-wilted city of Phoenix in the US state of Arizona, meanwhile, has already seen planes delayed from taking off when airport temperatures hit 120F (48C). And soaring thermometers in Los Angeles this summer led tens of thousands to lose power for days.\n",

            "Longer and hotter heatwaves driven by climate change are becoming an increasingly dangerous – and costly – menace, with sweltering cities often picking up the tab for everything from repairing melted roads to running more cooling centres.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the 1990s, utility companies in cities like Chicago have used weather derivatives – an early form of heat insurance – to hedge the cost of buying additional power on hot days when electricity demand outstrips supply, said Daniel Osgood of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI).\n",
            "\n",
            "Heat has also been an indirect part of “index-based” insurance for poor farmers, which provides automatic payouts for assumed crop losses if, for instance, enough days pass without rain, said Osgood, who has worked on developing such policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "But a wider range of heat insurance offerings – likely aimed initially at city authorities or similar government buyers around the world – are now being explored as the risks and costs of heatwaves rise, insurance experts said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Michael Spranger, of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), said insurance cannot fix the problem of heatwaves, which will increase in frequency if climate-heating emissions continue to rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "But “insurance helps to absolve some of the financial consequences”, said Spranger, chief risk management officer for the CCRIF, which runs a multi-country weather catastrophe insurance pool in the Caribbean and is expanding its remit.\n",
            "\n",
            "Barney Schauble, chairman of Nephila Climate, one of the companies figuring out ways to transfer risks from climate and weather threats, said as yet there is “no standard product that is heatwave insurance”.\n",
            "\n",
            "Instead, creating insurance that works for heatwaves requires taking a hard look at the risks a city or company wants to protect against, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Is it three consecutive days above 43C (110F)? A summer 20 percent hotter than usual? The key is figuring out what costs might result from that heat that usual budgets cannot cover, he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those will vary widely from place to place, but might include anything from utility bill support for the most vulnerable to run air-conditioning to covering income losses or providing compensation if airports or public transit shut down.\n",
            "\n",
            "Insurance removes uncertainty, he added – such as worries a heat disaster could eat up city budgets and result in potentially politically unpopular spending cuts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among other issues, for heat insurance to heat to work, it must be determined who would be financially responsible for losses and so needs to pay for policies, said Sophie Evans of the London-based Centre for Disaster Protection.\n",
            "\n",
            "“When the roads start to melt, whose job is it to manage those risks? Whose job is it to make sure people can get to work?” she asked. “That risk ownership is crucial.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Because richer countries produced the most planet-heating emissions, responsibility for the rising heat could lead wealthy nations to support heat policies for poorer ones as part of pledges to address climate “loss and damage” under the 2015 Paris Agreement, climate experts said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, there is “woeful under-funding to deal with heat risks” around the world, noted Julie Arrighi, an Africa-based climate adviser with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n",
            "\n",
            "One advantage of heat-menaced cities buying insurance, risk experts said, is that it would drive them to step up efforts to adapt – from planting more urban trees for shade to installing reflective roofs and pavements – in a bid to reduce premiums.\n",
            "\n",
            "But as emissions – and planetary heating – continue to rise, there will be limits to how effectively insurance can help deal with the threats, warned Madeleine Thomson, interim head of the London-based Wellcome Trust, a health charity.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Insurers like to insure things that don’t happen very often,” she noted. As heatwaves become fiercer and more prevalent, insurance policies “will be increasingly difficult to maintain”, she predicted.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the moment, cities and other potential buyers are not yet stepping forward to buy heat policies because big losses from heat still happen too infrequently – and because they are not aware coverage is possible, the insurance experts said.\n",

            "“You need to find early adopters who are thoughtful enough to say, ‘This makes sense,'” said Schauble of Nephila Climate. “Most will say, ‘I don’t want to be the first, just the second or fifth or tenth, once it’s proven.'”\n",

Green Umbrella’s 200 member organizations and governments collaborate on everything from watershed preservation and reducing food waste to energy and transportation policies. Paired with ambitious climate planning at the city level, the group’s efforts have resulted in a cleaner, greener Cincinnati—from its grocery stores and banks to its police stations and zoo.

            "Minutes after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley took to the steps of City Hall. There he told a crowd of reporters that Cincy would join the Compact of Mayors (now called the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy), a coalition of now more than 10,000 cities and local governments aiming to collectively lower their carbon emissions by 1.3 billion tons per year by 2030. Days later, Cranley drove down Kellogg Avenue, “and I looked at Lunken Airport, and I looked at the Water Works,” and said to himself, “You know, why don’t we put up a bunch of solar panels—here, on this land we own?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Within weeks, the mayor had committed the city to 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 and laid out a plan for a 25-megawatt photovoltaic array. With contracts currently under negotiation, the solar farm will power the Greater Cincinnati Water Works and the entire municipal government in what would be the country’s largest solar project owned and run by a city.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last year the city also updated its Green Cincinnati Plan. Launched in 2008, the plan now includes 80 strategies for cutting carbon pollution to 80 percent below 2006 levels by 2050. And as one of 25 cities chosen for the American Cities Climate Challenge (ACCC)—a partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies, NRDC, Delivery Associates, and several other organizations to reduce emissions in the buildings, energy, and transportation sectors—Cincinnati is furthering its commitments to renewable power generation and energy efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carla Walker, the city’s climate advisor, who has been busy working to get more (and more affordable) electric vehicles on Cincy streets, says Cincinnati’s climate measures have made it a model for peer cities, such as Indianapolis and Columbus. With a population of 300,000, Cincinnati may be the second-smallest ACCC city, but when it comes to ambitious emissions cuts, it makes the top five. “We’re punching above our weight,” says Walker.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fighting climate change, renewable power and energy efficiency work hand in hand. Cincinnati is among 22 American cities developing 2030 Districts, which are urban areas committed to slashing transportation emissions, energy use, and water consumption in half by 2030. So far, 25 Cincy property owners, developers, and commercial tenants have signed on, committing more than 20 million square feet—roughly the size of 25 Madison Square Gardens—to the 2030 goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of Cincinnati’s crown jewels of efficiency is a police station on its west side. The District 3 Police Station, which reopened in 2015 on the site of a former car dealership, is the city’s first LEED Platinum building. Replete with a 329-kilowatt solar array, a geothermal heating system, and a rain garden, the $16 million building runs on its own energy—and it’s open 24 hours a day, every day of the year. This may be the most sustainable police station the country has ever seen. And in a city dealing with severe flooding issues and stormwater overflows, the native vegetation planted in the station’s new retention basin helps keep the site’s water in place. This makes Mary Jo Bazely, a volunteer who gardens and plants trees for the Cincinnati Parks Foundation, very proud. “There’s more green now. The water’s staying on site. It’s been remediated,” says Bazely before listing off several of the station’s energy conservation features that community members like herself made sure were included—right down to the outlets in the police lockers where officers can charge their cell phones and walkie-talkies with power from the sun shining outside.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the net-zero police station is far from being the lone green jewel in this city. Tremaine Phillips, former director of Cincinnati 2030 District, can easily rattle off the achievements of several of the group’s partners.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fifth Third Bank, headquartered in Cincy, is the first Fortune 500 company to purchase 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources—in this case, a solar farm in North Carolina that “couldn’t have been built but for our contract,” says Scott Hassell, the bank’s director of environmental sustainability. The Kroger grocery chain, which is headquartered in Cincinnati and has nearly 2,800 stores across the United States, is committed to a Zero Hunger/Zero Waste program and has pledged to eliminate plastic bags by 2025. The Cincinnati Zoo, considered one of the nation’s most sustainable zoos, boasts the largest publicly accessible urban solar array in the country. And the headquarters of Procter & Gamble met its 2020 greenhouse emissions and water use reduction goals two years early (too bad the company remains bent on destroying the Canadian boreal, a forest critical to mitigating climate change) and has already achieved zero manufacturing waste at more than 80 percent of its sites nationwide. The list goes on.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the 1970s, a sizable chunk—about 33 percent—of Cincinnati’s population has moved out, mostly to the suburbs. But Chris Heckman and his wife, Kristen Myers, recently planted themselves firmly in the city proper. “We wanted something different for our kids, something more sustainable,” says Chris, a designer and local environmental volunteer who spent years as a stay-at-home parent. The family of four, whose roots lie elsewhere in the Midwest, bought an 1870 home built in Over-the-Rhine (OTR), a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood just north of the business district. While some OTR streets host entrepreneurs sporting beards and Warby Parkers, other blocks are quiet canyons of vacant buildings.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Heckman-Myers home had been one such vacant property. But with upgrades to its insulation, the addition of geothermal wells, rooftop solar panels, a Tesla Powerwall to store electricity, and a variety of other retrofits, the home is shooting for LEED Platinum certification. The family owns a car but usually takes public transit, including the Cincinnati streetcar, which runs in front of their house. (When Chris isn’t schlepping kids, he opts for a bike from the city’s bike-share program.) The Heckmans are eligible for federal tax refunds of 30 percent of what they paid for their solar and geothermal systems, and depending on the LEED level the house achieves, the household could be eligible for up to 15 years of city tax abatements, meaning they’d pay taxes only on the pre-improvement value of their property for those years.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I’m proud that Cincinnati is a leader in pushing what’s possible with sustainability goals,” says Chris, “but we all live on the planet, and wherever we live, we’ll need to be improving our climate aspirations.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, not everyone can afford to get their home LEED certified. Half of Cincinnati’s children under the age of five live in poverty. In some neighborhoods, like Avondale, the median yearly household income is as low as $18,120. For this segment of the population, the share of their incomes devoted to energy bills is among the highest in the nation. The settlement of a recent lawsuit involving Duke Energy rates includes the utility paying $250,000 per year for the next six years to fund energy efficiency upgrades for low-income tenants.\n",
            "\n",
            "Often overlooked in discussions of energy bills is the importance of trees. The shade they provide helps reduce the heat island effect, which lowers the need to crank up the A/C. This is especially important in lower-income neighborhoods, where many residents live without air-conditioning or have health issues that make them more heat-vulnerable. Cincinnati has 40 percent tree coverage, but this varies greatly among neighborhoods, with less-affluent ones having fewer trees. With a priority on tree-deficient areas, the city’s Street Tree Program spends roughly $2 million per year to plant trees along sidewalks, and its ReLeaf program so far has provided nearly 20,000 free trees for planting on private property throughout the city.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the trees grow, so does Cincinnati’s resilience. Still, like many cities, Cincy has a long way to go before achieving its sustainability and equity goals. On this front, the Queen City is just getting started, but within the new Green Cincinnati Plan, each proposal includes details about how the sustainability measure will also increase equity. As before, Cincinnati is facing its climate challenges with eyes wide open—and will, one hopes, continue to impress.\n",

He mentioned the equal division of capital grants allocation between and central and local governments as an instance of the move towards decentralisation. Bhutan has also identified 10 local government key result areas (KRA), aligned to the SDGs, in the 12th FYP, of which two are on climate actions.

However, she said, one challenge was that sub-national governments don’t have their own policies on actions to be taken. Even in the health sector, which is the primary responsibility of local governments, their mandate is not taken seriously.\n",

Through this financial instrument, local governments are being able to restore drinking water supply, renovate irrigation systems that had been washed away, construct causeways and bridges, among other efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change such as floods and landslides. A major impact of this grant, he said, was greater awareness among the people about climate change and its reality.\n",

Responding to a question on the critical steps needed for better vertical integration on climate action, Ms. Goonasekara said that sub-national governments should be encouraged to make their own policies; receive adequate technical support to upgrade their standards and regulations; and have better communication with the national governments to provide an enabling environment. Asked how mechanisms for the environment could be brought under gram panchayats in India, Mr. Yadav said that these units know best what their communities need, and if they were given enough resources to plan their future, it would empower the society and develop local governance.

            "(Bloomberg) — Janet Yellen has promised to make fighting climate change a priority as Treasury secretary, spurring hope among activists she will put the issue at the center of U.S. economic policy for the first time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Treasury Department, has already endorsed a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and urged countries to set up independent councils that can pursue aggressive climate policies without political interference.\n",
            "\n",
            "Advocates are appealing for her to go even further if confirmed, seizing her role as one of the most powerful people in finance to wield fiscal policy in the campaign against global warming. Some have outlined plans for how Yellen could trigger tighter regulation of oil and gas company finances under the Dodd-Frank Act — even going so far as to require them to sell off fossil fuel assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Yellen will have the power to help move trillions of dollars out of fossil fuels and trillions more into renewables,” said Jamie Henn, director of the non-profit advocacy group Fossil Free Media. “She could do more for the Green New Deal than nearly any other cabinet position.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen declined to be interviewed for this article. Biden’s transition team said the incoming administration intends to turn the threat of climate change into a way to bolster the economy and create jobs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen’s Treasury Department is expected to play a central role in that effort by helping shape stimulus spending to pull the U.S. out of recession and fulfill Biden’s promise to invest as much as $2 trillion on clean energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Both Biden and Yellen’s ambitions for big clean-energy spending could be constrained by Congress, where Republicans will hold at least 50 seats in the Senate. Conservatives have assailed congressional Democrats’ ambitions for a wave of spending to propel clean power and energy efficiency, including through expanded tax cuts and investments, as a socialist wish list.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen’s interest in addressing climate change dates to her time in the Clinton administration, when she was the head of the Council of Economic Advisers. And she doesn’t mince words about the threat.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It will have absolutely devastating consequences for humanity if we don’t address it, and time is running out to take the steps that are necessary,” she said in an October interview with Bloomberg News.\n",
            "\n",
            "Climate change is already affecting energy investments, raising the risk that oil, gas and coal reserves will lose value or be barred from development as governments clamp down on the greenhouse gas emissions generated by burning fossil fuels. Even non-energy investments in commercial buildings and real estate are at greater peril with the encroachment of rising seas and more intense storms fueled by climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen “understands the critical links between the country’s economic health and climate change,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. As Treasury chief, “Yellen would have strong authority to bring climate risks and opportunities more centrally into U.S. economic and financial systems.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Progressive Democrats argue that enlisting the Treasury Department in the battle against climate change is consistent with Biden’s plan to take a whole-of-government approach to the issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Critics of the approach say Congress — not the Treasury Department — should take the lead in addressing climate change and the financial risks it poses.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Significant new policy, like that addressing climate, shouldn’t be set by financial policy or any other statute that was never intended to address such a major issue,” said Kyle Isakower, a senior vice president at the American Council for Capital Formation, a free-market think tank. With legislation specifically designed to address the risks of climate change, “financial policy can play an appropriate role.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Any aggressive moves would invite conflict with the U.S. oil and gas industry, which is already bracing for the Biden administration to tighten environmental mandates on drilling and block development on federal lands.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some options, such as greater capital holding requirements for banks that have fossil investments, are “a terrible idea,” said Norbert Michel, director of Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "“If we are going to talk about a climate disaster where the Earth burns up, a bank holding an extra 2% capital or not lending to certain companies isn’t going to change that,” Michel said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen has advocated a plan to tax carbon dioxide emissions and rebate the revenue to consumers, calling it “the textbook solution to the problem of climate change.” The carbon tax approach, also backed by other former Fed chairs and prominent economists, is cast as an alternative to the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan from progressives for a “10-year national mobilization” to shift the U.S. to zero-emission energy sources with trillions in spending on social programs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen in October also joined former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney in urging governments to establish climate change councils empowered to confront the problem without political interference.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Treasury Department can have global influence by charting new climate finance strategies through the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Financing can be directed toward emissions-lowering projects overseas, with the Treasury encouraging the phaseout of fossil fuels subsidies as well as increased funding focused on closing coal plants.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen can start by simply addressing the issue — making the case to American workers and businesses that climate policies “can spur economic growth, ensure strong employment and resilient financial markets,” Duke University’s Tim Profeta and former White House officials Joseph Aldy and Himamauli Das wrote in a 24-page memo for the Biden-Harris transition.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The secretary of the Treasury and the Treasury Department are crucial to the success of the administration’s efforts to move the U.S. and global economy to a low-carbon trajectory and to protect the economy from climate change shocks,” the three wrote in their blueprint for the agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activists say one key platform Yellen will have is as head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which brings together the Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other agencies. The panel can direct individual agencies and regulators to better address specific risks, such as global warming.\n",
            "\n",
            "FSOC is “supposed to be a mechanism to force financial regulators to do their job” and address “emerging risks” and get “the entire financial system to focus on those, to regulate them better,” said Graham Steele, director of Stanford University’s Corporations and Society Initiative.\n",
            "\n",
            "As Treasury chief, Yellen could push the council to develop recommendations for climate-focused financial regulatory reform and regulations. She also could encourage the FSOC to label oil and gas companies as non-bank systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, a designation that would trigger enhanced regulation and supervision by the Fed.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to craft “enhanced prudential standards” for any designated non-bank SIFIs, and the council has the authority to recommend what the standards should be.\n",
            "\n",
            "Applying such a designation could allow the Fed to require stress testing on the oil and gas industry -– with company portfolios evaluated under scenarios involving strict greenhouse gas emissions limits or rapid global temperature change. The Fed could use the findings to set capital limits and restrict fossil fuel investments on the basis of their prospective risks to financial security.\n",
            "\n",
            "The idea has gotten a boost from corporate watchdogs and environmental activists, including the Evergreen Action group founded by former aides to Washington State Governor Jay Inslee’s presidential campaign.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The Treasury Department has the power to disentangle our financial system from fossil fuel investments which put us all at risk, make substantive green investments and stabilize our financial system,” Evergreen Action said in a policy memo.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Federal Reserve Bank is taking steps to address the issue, with a Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco conference last year, and in November, the Fed’s first-ever declaration that climate change poses a risk to financial stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yellen, a former Fed chair who understands that governments and companies prefer certainty, said in the Bloomberg News interview that a “predictable path” is the best course.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s “not saying we need to tear down every power plant that still uses coal,” she said. “But when new power plants are built the incentives need to be there to do something that’s emits fewer greenhouse gases.”\n",

You hear scientists telling you what you ought to do, [but] it doesn’t stop people from gathering without masks in close quarters because they don’t get the immediate consequences of that action,” Sterman said.\n",

            "There is similar amnesia regarding climate change. “The presumption . . .  is that the harms from burning carbon today will only show up and hurt our children and our grandchildren.

            "\n",
            "Just as the debate over when to reopen the economy should not be presented as a choice between lives lost or jobs saved, climate action is not inherently in conflict with economic growth. With COVID-19 as with climate change, science is the solution, Sterman said.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s totally unacceptable to harm the economy in order to cut our carbon emissions. What we have to do is find a way to do both: to preserve a healthy, prosperous economy with opportunity for everybody, while we cut our carbon emissions,” Sterman said.\n",

But to imagine that China’s strategy is a propagandistic diversion or a concession to Western diplomacy—a liberal quid pro quo for Xi’s dictatorship—is both to overestimate Western leverage and to underestimate the climate problem. It is precisely because the Communist Party regime is bent on shaping the next century that its leader takes climate change seriously. In the calculus of the regime, Yangtze river floods are, like Hong Kong rights protestors, a threat to its grip on power. The future for Beijing’s authoritarian China Dream looks far more uncertain in a world of runaway global warming.\n",

            "Xi’s move may scramble Western preconceptions, but it has been obvious since the beginning of this century that China would have the decisive voice in the future of the global climate. A quarter century before it is expected to overtake the United States in terms of GDP, China surpassed it in terms of carbon emissions. China dominates all the heavily polluting industries worldwide—coal, steel, aluminum, cement. Once this could have been attributed to offshored Western production. Today, China consumes most of its heavy industrial output at home. With his decarbonization commitment, which eclipses any plausible future move that the EU or the United States might make, Xi has simply made clear where the real decision lies.\n",

            "As a result, we are already well past the point at which global stabilization can be achieved by a deal between the G3. What both Western and Chinese climate policy need is a stabilization pact that involves not only India, but other big emerging market economies like Brazil and Indonesia, future population giants like Pakistan and Nigeria and the big coal, oil, and gas producers, like Australia, Canada, Russia, and the Gulf states. Those debates have been going on for years at global climate talks. But the announcement by China changes the game for all the players.\n",
            "\n",
            "The U.S. narratives of climate politics tend to center on the global agreement at Paris in 2015, the first occasion on which virtually every country on earth agreed to take steps to address global warming. But Paris was deceptive. It set a temperature target of 2 degrees, and an aspiration to achieve no more than 1.5, whilst leaving it up to each nation to commit to whatever it could manage. It defused the explosive question of the just allocation of the remaining carbon budget by ignoring it. The result was a package of commitments, which modelling showed to be completely inadequate to achieving the temperature goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "Global emissions have continued to rise. The overall energy mix has hardly shifted. Economic growth wipes out any energy efficiency gains. Trump’s withdrawal from Paris made an already disastrous situation worse, opening the door to backsliding by the Brazilians, Australians, Russians, and Saudis. It was this profoundly alarming situation that triggered the grassroots political mobilization for climate action that has been such a remarkable feature of the last few years. As the year started, the question was whether America’s exit from Paris would be offset by new commitments from the EU and China.\n",
            "\n",
            "Xi’s announcement has gone further than anyone anticipated. In 2015, the refusal by China to commit to a definitive emissions path defined the Paris fudge. If the biggest piece of the future refused to be pinned down, there was no way to even define the equation to be solved. Now, Beijing has staked its claim. It has abandoned once and for all the line that separated emerging from advanced economies in previous climate talks. This will make it harder for Europe to renege and it will put significant pressure on India as well as the United States. But it also marks the terminus for the strategy of superpower bargaining that laid the groundwork for Paris. Now we have to finally come to terms with multipolarity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, in the 1990s, what had once been a preserve of elite Western scientists exploded into the raucous politics of modern global climate negotiations. The annual gathering of the 197 Parties that have joined the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change—the so-called Conferences of the Parties (COPs)—are U.N. general assembly-style meetings and they are as cumbersome and complex as that would suggest. As exemplified by the Kyoto protocol of 1997, the fundamental conflict was between the big emerging markets led by China and India, which insisted that the climate problem was for the industrialized economies to fix, and the United States, which refused to sign up to any deal that did not include China. This was at the root of U.S. opposition to the Kyoto protocol. Of course, there was also the know-nothing anti-science stance adopted by some in the GOP. There were fossil fuel interests led by Exxon that sponsored denial. But, in the end, the objection to the Kyoto Protocol, shared virtually unanimously by both sides of Congress, was geoeconomic. Whatever the history of emissions, China was a future climate superpower and the United States would not ratify an agreement that did not bind it as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was the interpretation of the climate problem in terms of climate justice on the part of China and India, and geoeconomics on the part of the United States, that in the end necessitated a superpower bargain. At first it was the Europeans who brought India and China to the table by making a unilateral commitment to a second round of Kyoto cuts. Then, the Obama administration brokered bilateral bargains with China and India. It was those superpower deals that set the stage for the climactic general assembly in Paris in December 2015.\n",
            "\n",
            "China has now doubled down on the Paris framework. For the first time since climate talks began in the early 1990s, the largest emitter has committed to decarbonization. But important as that is, it will not, by itself, be enough. What Beijing and anyone else who cares about climate stabilization needs now is not just a parallel commitment by the United States but binding commitments to deep decarbonization from the rest of the world. And for that, we will need a suitable tent.\n",
            "\n",
            "When it comes to driving decarbonization, the relevant group of countries is large and heterogeneous. It includes both big energy users and big energy producers. Decarbonization may be an overall net benefit. But the distributional trade-offs are painful. And some states may feel themselves to be net losers. No other emerging market has China’s resources to offset the sectoral cost of energy transition. No other state, rich or poor, can match the authoritarian capacity of the Chinese regime to repress dissent among the domestic losers of transition. The middle-income energy producers are desperate to maintain their oil and gas exports. Many middle- and low-income economies will be susceptible to offers of cheap energy with no strings attached. Around the world, energy subsidies running into the hundreds of billions of dollars per annum continue to be an important part of the social bargain, especially for the aspiring middle-class. Worldwide, hundreds of millions of people still lack access to electricity. If it is hard for rich countries to imagine a transition, it is all the more difficult for those still in the early stages of industrialization.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are several hundred large and profitable corporations whose entire business model will be upended by rapid and deep decarbonization. Western oil majors like Exxon are high on that list. But of the ten companies that most dramatically increased their CO2 emissions over the last five years, four were Indian, two were Chinese, the others were Australian, Russian, and Korean. Swiss-based LafargeHolcim, cement supplier to the world, came in at number two. Energy is a business for state capitalists. Twelve of the top 20 corporate CO2 emitters are state-owned. The national oil corporations of Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Algeria, and Venezuela are not just businesses. They are pillars of their national economies and state finances.\n",

            "One worry must be that recalcitrant coalitions will develop, whose projects for energy autonomy and economic development thwart the overall decarbonization push. Even within the EU, Poland, with its heavy reliance coal, has refused to join the otherwise unanimous commitment to net zero by 2050. In July this year, it used its bargaining power to puncture the carbon credentials of the European corona recovery pact. Repeated on a global scale, that is a worrying prospect. The increasingly frantic struggle for influence over the gas fields of the eastern Mediterranean is a case in point. Turkey has a rapidly growing demand for energy. It wants new sources of gas to relieve its alarming dependence on gas imports from Russia.\n",

            "The G20’s origins are in the controversy caused by the Latin American debt crisis and the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s. Harking back to its foundation at the Bretton Woods meeting of 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which led the crisis-fighting efforts, was dominated by its American and European shareholders. In the post-Cold War, postcolonial world, its heavy-handed methods were seen as an increasingly unacceptable intrusion on sovereignty. The G20 was rigged together in 1999 as a way of providing the management of the world economy with a broader political base. The story goes that then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers tasked his deputy, Timothy Geithner, together with his German counterpart, Caio Koch-Weser, with compiling a list of candidate states. Going down a table of population and GDP, they ticked France and South Africa in, Nigeria and Spain out. The result was a grouping dominated by the G-8 and the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), with the addition of newcomers to the top table such as Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Argentina, Mexico, and Turkey.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was originally a meeting of finance ministers. When the banking crisis erupted in the North Atlantic in 2008, it was upgraded to a forum for heads of government. Of course, such selective groupings have their own legitimacy issues. The G20 was denounced as a return to the 19th-century “concert of the powers.” But that was precisely the point. The notion of sovereignty, which treats states with populations counted in the thousands as the equals of China or India, may satisfy international lawyers but it flies in the face of real differences in capacities and power. The reason that the G20 may not be suitable for the next phase of climate policy is not that it excludes small countries but that it does not include the right big ones. In making climate policy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey are all crucial. But how can large states such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Nigeria, and Iran be excluded? A suitable forum for hard bargaining to address the impending climate catastrophe needs to be a G40 rather than a G20.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, imagining a forum is one thing, the next question is: What forces might actually compel agreement? If China and the EU are leading the decarbonization push, what influence might they have in accelerating the process?\n",
            "\n",
            "If history tells us anything, it is that far-off great powers can have only a limited sway. Informal empire is not as easy as it looks. Real influence depends on alignment with the interests of powerful local actors and comes at the price of heavy investment and at considerable risk. That is exactly what China embarked on with the sprawling One Belt One Road initiative. As of last year, 126 countries were involved in the BRI. At that time, those countries accounted for two thirds of the world’s population, 23 percent of the world’s GDP and about 28 percent of global carbon emissions. They are also home to 75 percent of the world’s known fossil fuel reserves. If they continue down the road of carbon-intensive growth modelled by China whilst the rest of the world proceeds to decarbonize, the result by 2050 would be that China’s One Belt One Road clients would end up responsible for 66 percent of global emissions. The belching smoke from their power stations would by itself be sufficient to pitch the world into a scenario of 3 degrees of warming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beijing has in the past made promises to “green” the One Belt One Road. But in his historic address to the U.N. General Assembly, Xi made no mention of China’s foreign projects. It will be a crucial test whether Beijing’s commitment to carbon neutrality applies to One Belt One Road. This may face opposition from China’s heavy industrial lobby, but Beijing has a huge lever in the form of its development banks. China Development Bank alone is expected to lend $40-45 billion annually to BRI projects.\n",
            "\n",
            "But while China is in the habit of projecting external financing on the scale of trillions of dollars, for the West that number will likely induce sticker shock. When Germany, a few years ago, floated the idea of a Marshall Plan for Africa, it immediately concluded that the $600 billion per annum required to meet U.N. sustainable development goals could not come from public funds. Rather than “boots on the ground” interventions in local infrastructure, Berlin fervently hoped that African states’ own resources and private capital would do the trick.\n",
            "\n",
            "If that really is the best the West can do, the question is how to incentivize the investment that is needed. Regulations, like bans on the import of internal combustion engine cars, are essential. Equally important would be a uniform global carbon price to set a floor for global trade. That starts with regional carbon pricing schemes but must move beyond those to carbon border taxes. This is crucial not just as a national measure, but also to contain the strategies of multinationals that will otherwise outsource carbon-intensive production to emerging markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "The EU brought the threat of carbon taxes into play with China this summer. It may have helped to sway Xi to make his announcement. Based on its market size, the EU is a regulatory superpower. The United States could be too. But increasingly, the most dynamic axis of global trade is not with the West, but between large and rapidly growing emerging markets. China is developing a carbon pricing mechanism. As a giant market for imports from lower-cost emerging markets, China may well want to implement carbon border taxes. If adopted by the EU, United States and China, carbon taxes would exercise a huge pressure on energy choices around the world. Exporting countries that used solar and wind power, rather than coal, oil and gas would be at a huge advantage; money would surely follow.\n",
            "\n",
            "And a narrow focus on prices and short-term profit margins may underestimate the forces that are at work. There are signs that, like the communist regime in Beijing, “big money” in the West is beginning to take a strategic view. In the week before Xi’s speech to the UN, Climate Action 100 Plus, a lobby group whose members represent global investors with a collective $47 trillion in assets, announced that it would be judging 161 of the largest companies, collectively responsible for up to 80 percent of global industrial greenhouse gases, by their progress towards net-zero carbon emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like Xi’s speech there was no doubt an element of greenwashing in this statement. But it can also be read as a recognition by giant asset managers like BlackRock and Pimco that the stability of capital accumulation depends in the long run on maintaining a stable environmental envelope. For Western capital as for Xi’s regimes, those risks are political as well as physical. In the event of future climate crises, firms that might be seen as recklessly endangering climate stability may be at risk of suddenly losing their license to operate. The experience of the airlines in 2020 has shown how suddenly the societal response to a future environmental crisis might jeopardize an entire industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is tempting, therefore, to hope that with the climate commitments of China and the EU, the world has achieved critical mass. Technological change, regulatory leadership, price incentives, and investor pressure will drive decarbonization. But to count on these forces alone is naïve.\n",

            "The fossil fuel systems that define our lives are anchored not just in technology and profit. Decarbonization, like the construction of the fossil fuel economy in the first place, will involve questions of international power and geopolitics. There are those who hold to the dream of the 1970s that renewable energy may ultimately usher in a new era of “soft,” decentralized energy, and politics to match. But even if that unlikely vision remains a goal, getting there requires an act of power—the dismantling of the bastions of fossil energy. They will not simply give way. Indeed, as has recently been pointed out by Jason Bordoff, the geopolitics of decarbonization will be complex and nonlinear. And this is where the United States comes in.\n",
            "\n",
            "China and the EU are setting the decarbonization agenda. But neither of them has America’s geopolitical reach. A progressive policy push from the U.S. side would make it easier to make the case for decarbonization in India, Latin America, Canada, and Japan. A shift in stance in the United States would also reverse Trump’s climate-skeptic bandwagon that conservative governments in Australia and Brazil have happily joined. This is one area where leading from behind may not be an oxymoron.\n",
            "\n",
            "The United States does have a unique role with regard to fossil fuel producers. The United States was the architect and anchor of the 20th-century fossil fuel order. When American progressives fondly invoke the Green New Deal and the achievements of the “arsenal of democracy” in World War II, we should not forget that those were triumphs of an oil and coal-fueled industrialism. It was in the mid-century heyday of state activism and creative American statecraft that the oil empire in the Middle East—the nexus of oil corporations, the American national security apparatus, and local regimes—was first forged. America’s Cold War alliances both in Western Europe and East Asia were built on that Mid-East energy platform.\n",
            "\n",
            "The 1973 crisis put that system in question. In the 1970s, the U.S. government made itself into the lead sponsor of the early science of climate change and renewable energy. But, in the end, as Victor McFarland has shown us with his innovative new study Oil Powers, the United States opted for the alliance with Saudi Arabia and the Carter Doctrine, which made explicit America’s commitment to defending the West’s supply of oil. This set the course for decades of ever deeper and more militarized engagement in the Middle East.\n",

            "Weary of the ruinously expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the large-scale commercial application of fracking appeared to offer the United States a trump card both in grand strategy and climate policy. But the new boast of energy independence under Obama, all too easily morphed into a claim to energy dominance under Trump. Rather than exiting the fossil fuel power game, the United States was sucked into a new iteration. As an alternative to Russian gas, the United States positioned itself as a purveyor of LNG—rebranded by the Trump administration as “molecules of freedom.” As the recent price war in oil has demonstrated, the result of the overexpansion of the fracking sector wasn’t dominance for the United States, but new vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, the geopolitics of the exit from fossil fuels are not an American problem alone. For the last half century, Europe built its relationship with the Soviet Union and then with Russia on an energy import policy. (The Nordstream 2 pipeline is the offspring of that history.) Japan and now China are the major customers of the Gulf states. The leading OPEC states have considerable reserves and they vigorously assert their autonomy. In the Gulf, production costs are so low that states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar can confidently expect to be amongst the last suppliers of fossil fuels to the world. Fragile high-cost producers, the likes of Nigeria or Venezuela for instance, will feel the pinch first. But eventually, the balance of demand and supply will shift and, if minimum carbon pricing works, price wars will offer no escape. Between 2040 and 2060, the century of the oil-fueled global economy will come to an end.\n",
            "\n",
            "This will be a revolutionary transformation, and the United States must carefully calibrate its intervention. There are of course plenty of reasons to welcome the disempowering of both Russia and Saudi Arabia. Visions of regime change will be tempting. But we should be clear about the risks. Simply to face the fossil-fuel producers with a fait accompli, with no way out, will incite resistance and encourage beleaguered incumbents to make dangerous gambles for salvation. Such a confrontational approach may appeal to those who want to see not so much a Green New Deal as a Green Revolution.\n",

            "But if the timeline is as pressing as the science suggests, then the absolute priority is decarbonization. To that end we need to devise off ramps and ways of converting existing assets and wealth into claims on a new, low-carbon world.

We weren’t the bonnet-wearing, buggy-riding sort, but we embraced some traditions, like the Anabaptist teaching of nonviolence. This sometimes expressed itself in an instinct for conflict avoidance. I took that further than most, tending to stay away from arguments, competitive sports, and eating meat.\n",

            "So I was surprised when violence crept into my speech three years ago when I started working as a journalist covering climate change. Some ancient spirit took hold of me, and I found myself deploying the narrative of war. Carbon tax proposals were “battles” to be fought. Greenhouse gas emissions had to be “slashed.” As for climate change itself? Well, that was an issue to “fight” — and “eco-warriors” and “climate hawks” were leading the charge.\n",

            "I’d adopted the language of the climate movement’s leaders who’d gone all out with the wartime cliches. The only way to overcome climate change inaction, environmentalist (and Grist board member) Bill McKibben once wrote, “is to adopt a wartime mentality, rewriting the old mindset that stands in the way of victory.” Hillary Clinton reportedly wanted to equip the White House with “a situation room just for climate change.” Author and activist Naomi Klein and newly elected Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among other advocates, are calling for a World War II-scale mobilization against global warming.\n",

But that’s not always the case, as the linguist Deborah Tannen wrote in The Argument Culture: Stopping America’s War of Words back in 1998. Military and sports metaphors train us to see everything in terms of conflict — this side versus that side — and that perspective limits our collective imagination about what we can do to fix complex problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Coming from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I’ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words. The thought struck me earlier this year: By pitting one group against another, do war metaphors undermine our ability to address the complex problem of climate change, the biggest global crisis we face? Are there other ways to frame our predicament and convey the sense of urgency that’s needed — without dividing us into Hatfields and McCoys?\n",

            "\n",
            "Reading Tannen’s book, I saw these metaphors in a new light. There’s a “pervasive warlike culture” in the U.S. that leads us to approach just about any major issue as if it were “a battle or game in which winning or losing is the main concern,” she wrote. It’s a deeply entrenched cultural tendency that has shaped politics, education, law, and the media.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tannen traces this American spirit back to Ancient Greece. Aristotelian philosophy sought to uncover truth through adversarial debate — an approach that shapes how we think today. Ideally, that meant a respectful argument where opponents sought middle ground. That ideal has increasingly been thrown out the window: Remember former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s dream of having a military-style debate where “red-team, blue-team” scientists would debate the validity of climate change on live TV?\n",

            "Hostility is definitely in fashion. Anger spreads faster across social media networks than any other emotion, as studies have shown (and anyone who’s spent more than one minute on Twitter can attest). Cable news has devolved into shouting matches.\n",

            "I’m wary of telling strangers that I’m a climate journalist. It’s not just that rising seas and bigger hurricanes are unpleasant topics.

It’s not in my nature.\n",

The future of humanity is at stake. Will you join our fight for justice?\n",

            "This rally-the-troops tone reminds me of the old Uncle Sam posters created during World War I. “I want you,” the poster says, with a stern Sam extending a forefinger, “for U.S. army.” It’s an aggressive moral appeal, explicitly trying to arouse an emotional reaction and a commensurate commitment. The enemy is coming. Are you with us?\n",

            "In wartime, not taking sides is almost as bad as betrayal. During World War I, at least 138 Mennonites who refused military service were court-martialed and sent to jail. Many others were sent to army camps where they were ridiculed and even tortured for their commitment to nonviolence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maybe that’s why Uncle Sam’s message doesn’t work on me. I was raised to be suspicious of war rhetoric and nationalism. As the only Mennonite kid in my elementary school classes, I remember standing respectfully and silently as my classmates said the Pledge of Allegiance. At my Mennonite college, there was no Star-Spangled Banner before sporting events; it had too many bombs bursting in air, never mind the rockets’ red glare.\n",

            "Mennonites don’t typically pledge allegiance to the “nation-state,” you see. God comes first. From their start in the late 16th century, my Anabaptist ancestors in Europe were persecuted by Roman Catholic and Protestant authorities for their radical beliefs. Crazy stuff like arguing for the separation of church and state, refusing military service, and baptizing adults instead of babies. Some were burned at the stake; others fled and learned to lie low — “the quiet in the land,” they were called.\n",
            "\n",
            "I get that this war message works for some people, though. In a study published in the journal Environmental Communication last year, participants read one of three articles about the effort to reduce carbon emissions, which was framed as either a “war,” a “race,” or an “issue.” Those who read the war version perceived the most “urgency and risk” and expressed “greater willingness to increase conservation behavior.”\n",
            "\n",
            "That’s the spirit behind The Climate Mobilization, a group that invokes the war mentality in the service of climate action.

            "\n",
            "Shortly after the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. had overhauled its economy and society for the war effort. Government spending soared from 30 percent of the economy in 1941 to 79 percent at the peak of the war in 1944. With a shared sense of national purpose, people made sacrifices for the common good. They planted victory gardens, bought war bonds, and rallied to produce the tanks, planes, and machine guns needed to fight a global war.\n",
            "\n",
            "Klein Salamon said climate change is such an enormous threat to the planet that it demands similar sacrifices. “That’s really the challenge we face now,” she told me. “Can we achieve the mentality we had as a species that we had [achieved] only exclusively during wartime?”\n",

In one of the side events focused on the oceans, Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean, told the audience that it has taken a long time to get to the point of having a “blue COP.” “It’s the first time the ocean is fully integrated and where it should be,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the Paris Agreement only mentions oceans in the preamble, there are now calls for the inclusion of blue carbon — the carbon captured by the world's oceans — and coastal ecosystems in countries’ revised nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, which are due to be submitted in 2020. There is also a proposed work program specifically for the ocean, as well as Article 6 on carbon markets and international cooperation.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Oceans have been missing in the climate change debate,” said Minna Epps, director of the global marine and polar program at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. “Progress has been made in the last 10 years … But for someone who lives and breathes in the realm of the ocean, I think it’s still far too underrepresented, especially if you look at the NDCs.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Epps noted that currently only 19% of NDCs from countries with coastal ecosystems refer to nature-based solutions, or NBS, which are actions that sustainably manage, protect, and restore natural or modified ecosystems and are often discussed as one way to help build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Coastal and marine ecosystems, such as mangroves, and other wetlands, such as peatlands, are relatively poorly represented for mitigation purposes, added Epps.\n",

            "As the oceans become warmer, sea levels rise — causing flooding and coastal erosion — and the increased heat content of the ocean fuels more intense hurricanes and cyclones, while marine heat waves lead to huge coral-bleaching events. The effects of ocean acidification are also starting to be seen — although predicted impacts on food webs are yet to be observed — as is deoxygenation, which has potentially devastating effects on biodiversity, marine ecosystems, biomass, and availability of habitats. This, in turn, could have wide-ranging socioeconomic consequences, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that depend on fisheries and reef-based tourism.\n",
            "\n",
            "Released by IUCN during COP25, a new report on ocean deoxygenation — a topic that is barely mentioned in the Paris Agreement — found that the average amount of oxygen in the oceans has already reduced globally by 2%.\n",
            "\n",
            "That may sound like very little, Epps said, but more extreme figures are also being seen — for example, a 30% decrease of oxygen in waters off the coast of California and the occurrence of one hypoxic event in Panama that resulted in a 75% loss of coral diversity.\n",

            "Taholo Kami, Fiji’s special representative for oceans, said that while some people at COP said oceans “are a distraction” and the focus should be on emissions, those coming from the ocean states “can’t separate climate from the oceans.” According to Kami, the two are connected: Much of the focus in negotiations has been on the obviously devastating effects of climate change on the oceans and less on the role the oceans play in climate mitigation. According to a report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in September, the ocean has absorbed 20% to 30% of carbon dioxide emitted since the 1980s. Other research estimates it has also absorbed more than 90% of the heat gained by the planet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kami warned, however, that the role that the ocean is currently playing may not be permanent: If the ocean starts to put out more carbon than it absorbs, then that’s a very different scenario. “I shudder to think what happens when the dynamics change — especially in a warming ocean space,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We don’t know how much and how soon, but warming waters not only change the composition of the oceans so you get acidification, but also increases the likelihood of more disruptive storms that destroy everything and much of the upper layer of the water,” Kami said. “We need to keep emissions targets aligned with the biggest impact areas … and the ocean is the biggest by far.”\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Nature-based solutions\" have been hailed as a vital part of the battle against climate change, but some critics warn the rapid rise of this agenda risks harming local communities and deflecting attention away from the need to rapidly decarbonize the global economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Certain nature-based solutions, including mangrove planting and coral reef restoration, could be a key part of helping to ensure that some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change can help protect their coastlines and livelihoods.\n",
            "\n",
            "“When we talk about NBS, it is to maintain ecosystems’ integrity so they are intact and functioning as a whole, because it is all intertwined,” Epps said, adding that it is vital to recognize that nature-based solutions concern both mitigation and adaptation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Marine protected areas, or MPAs, are also an “essential tool towards a healthy ocean” and an important way to help build resilience, Kami said. At the helm of the Ocean and Climate Change Action Group as part of the Commonwealth’s Blue Charter, Fiji has already committed to ensuring that 30% of its coastlines will be MPAs by 2030, Kami said. He added that this 10-year timeline provides an opportunity to ensure rigorous management, making sure that the 30% commitment covers the most important ecosystems. And starting Jan. 1 of 2020, single-use plastics will be banned in Fiji.\n",

            "“We need to keep our patch of the ocean abundant and productive … Anything you can do to build resilience — meaning less pollution, all the other impacts we could control, and protected areas — [are] the only tools you have that’s in our control when you can’t touch the emissions cycle,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "“People are seeing species they haven’t seen in 30 years. The size of fish starts to change, diversity improves,” Kami said, noting that since these areas are locally managed, they could also help create jobs and secure livelihoods.\n",

At the COP25 side event titled “Climate-Proofing Our Oceans and Coasts Through Nature-Based Solutions,” Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland flagged Seychelles’ achievement of 30% marine protection by 2020 — 10 years ahead of global ambitions — which was met by applause from the audience. The goal of 30% marine protection by 2030 has not been adopted as an international target yet, though there is growing support for this to be adopted next year.\n",

Championing the Commonwealth Blue Charter Action Group on Mangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods, the country has so far allocated 14,000 hectares of land for mangrove restoration. These have, in turn, created nurseries for fish, improving the lives of fishers and securing livelihoods, Scotland said.\n",

            "MADRID — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres urged countries Monday not to lose hope in the fight against climate change, as representatives from nearly 200 countries gathered in Madrid for a two-week meeting on tackling global warming.\n",
            "\n",
            "In his opening speech to delegates, Guterres cited recent scientific data showing that levels of heat-trapping gases have hit a record high, reaching levels not seen for at least 3 million years when sea levels were 33-66 feet higher than today.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unless emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are sharply cut, temperatures could rise to twice the threshold set in the 2015 Paris accord by the end of the century, he warned.\n",
            "\n",
            "His appeal came after Chile’s environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, said the Dec. 2-13 meeting needs to lay the groundwork for moving toward carbon-neutral economies while being sensitive to the poorest and those most vulnerable to rising temperatures — something that policymakers have termed “just transition.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Those who don’t want to see it will be on the wrong side of history,” said Schmidt, who is chairing the meeting. She called on governments to make more ambitious pledges to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ahead of a deadline to do so next year.\n",
            "\n",
            "The summit, which moved to the Spanish capital after Chile had to pull out amid anti-government protests, aims to put the finishing touches to the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord.\n",
            "\n",
            "That involves creating a functioning international emissions-trading system and compensating poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Countries agreed in Paris four years ago to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. Already, average temperatures have increased by about 1C, leaving little room for the more ambitious target to be met.\n",
            "\n",
            "Guterres called out big greenhouse gas emitters that are still building coal-fired power plants, saying that unless the world stops burning coal “all our efforts to tackle climate change will be doomed.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Ten years ago, if countries had acted on the science, they would have needed to reduce emissions by 3.3% each year,” he said. “Today, we need to reduce emissions by 7.6% each year.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“The impact on all life on the planet — including ours — would be catastrophic,” he added. “The only solution is rapid, ambitious, transformative action by all — governments, regions, cities, businesses and civil society, all working toward a common goal.”\n",

            "It was a balmy June day in 2017 when Donald Trump took to the lectern in the White House Rose Garden to announce the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, the only comprehensive global pact to tackle the spiraling crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I found it sickening, it was mendacious from start to finish,\" said Stern. \"I was furious … because here we have this really important thing and here's this joker who doesn't understand anything he's talking about. It was a fraud.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The terms of the accord mean no country can leave before November this year, so due to a quirk of timing, the US will officially exit the Paris deal on November 4 – just one day after the 2020 presidential election.\n",
            "\n",
            "The completion of Stern's misery, and possibly any realistic hopes of averting disastrous climate change, rests heavily upon the outcome of the election, which will pit Trump against former vice-president Joe Biden, who has vowed to rejoin the climate agreement.\n",
            "\n",
            "The lifetime of the Paris agreement, signed in a wave of optimism in 2015, has seen the five hottest years ever recorded on Earth, unprecedented wildfires torching towns from California to Australia, record heatwaves baking Europe and India and temperatures briefly bursting beyond 100 degrees farenheit (38 celsius) in the Arctic.\n",
            "\n",
            "These sorts of impacts could be a mere appetizer, scientists warn, given they have been fueled by levels of global heating that are on track to triple, or worse, by the end of the century without drastic remedial action. The faltering global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and head off further calamity hinges, in significant part, on whether the US decides to re-enter the fray.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The choice of Biden or Trump in the White House is huge, not just for the US but for the world generally to deal with climate change,\" said Stern. \"If Biden wins, November 4 is a blip, like a bad dream is over. If Trump wins, he seals the deal. The US becomes a non-player and the goals of Paris become very, very difficult. Without the US in the long term, they certainly aren't realistic.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Nearly 200 countries put their name to the Paris accords, pledging to face down the climate emergency and limit the average global temperature rise to \"well below\" 2 degrees celsius above the era before mass industrialization started pumping huge volumes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere from cars, trucks, power plants and farms. A more aspirational goal of halting temperatures at a 1.5 degrees celsius rise was also included although, just five years on, the planet is already creeping perilously close to this mark.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paris deal brought major, growing emitters like China and India on board with the quest to shift towards cleaner sources of energy, in part due to the urgings of Barack Obama, who claimed the agreement showed the US was now a \"global leader in the fight against climate change.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Trump, who once famously called climate science a \"hoax,\" has never looked kindly on the deal, which he framed as an international effort to damage the US while letting China off too lightly. In his Rose Garden speech, Trump remarked that he was elected to \"represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" In reality, each country is free to choose its own emissions cuts without any sort of enforcement. \"Paris is like a vessel, such as a glass – you can pour water or wine into it,\" said Sue Biniaz, a former US state department lawyer who drafted parts of the Paris deal. \"It's not the design of Paris that’s the problem, it's that there's not the political will to do enough.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The US government in practice abandoned any concern over the climate crisis some time ago, with the Trump administration so far rolling back more than 100 environmental protections, including an Obama-era plan to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants, limits on pollution emitted from cars and trucks and even energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs. In an often chaotic presidency, Trump's position on climate change has been unusually consistent – American fossil fuel production must be bolstered, restrictive climate regulations must be scrapped.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unswayed by growing alarm among Americans over the climate crisis, Trump is taking this same message to the election. \"Biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the Paris climate accord, which would kill our energy totally, you would have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development,\" the president said this month, without citing evidence, as he announced another rollback, this time of environmental assessments of pipelines, highways and other infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite all this, US emissions have continued to fall, due in large part to the downfall of a coal industry that Trump has attempted to prop up. The international ramifications have been telling, however – in the absence of any sort of positive cajoling from the US, global emissions have remained stubbornly high and most countries are lagging behind their own promised actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the Climate Action Tracker, only Morocco is acting consistently with the Paris agreement's goals, with the global temperature rise set to exceed 3 degrees celsius by the end of the century even if the current pledges are met. Paris was meant to be only the beginning – countries are supposed to continually ratchet up their ambition levels until the more extreme ravages of climate change, such as dire flooding, heatwaves, crop failures and the loss of coral reefs, are avoided.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"There's been less political will from other countries to take action to a certain extent because the US isn't pushing for it,\" said Biniaz. \"During the first four years of Trump it's easier to say it's likely to be an aberration, a short-term deviation, but if it's eight years it's harder to keep together the coalition of countries that care about this.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Another four years of a Trump administration uninterested in the climate crisis could set back global emissions cuts by a decade, according to one published analysis, making the chances of meeting the goals of Paris near to impossible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hakon Saelen, an environmental economist at the University of Oslo who led the study, said the US withdrawal is a \"significant major blow\" to the mitigation of the climate crisis. \"The world cannot afford any delay if the 2 degrees celsius target is to be reached,\" he said. \"Our model indicates that the chance of reaching it is very low already, but near zero with another Trump term.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But even with an engaged Biden administration that is somehow able to get Congress to agree to a $2 trillion plan to shift the US on to renewable energy, the challenge is immense. The world has dithered on cutting emissions for so long that only an unprecedented, rapid overhaul of the way we travel, generate energy and eat will keep humanity within the bounds of safety outlined in Paris.\n",
            "\n",
            "The world will have to slash emissions by more than 7% a year this decade to have any hope of meeting the 1.5 celsius target, according to the United Nations. This annual cut will be achievable this year only through the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered much of the global economy. A more sustainable path to decarbonization will need to be immediately identified and implemented.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The warmer it gets the worse it gets and the [Paris] targets are broadly at a level where things will get really bad,\" said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute. \"We don't want people to give up hope, the human race won't become extinct at 2 degrees celsius but that's an unnecessarily high bar. There are still large threats and a lot of good reasons to keep warming below that.\n",

            "Stern said American voters will naturally be \"supersonic focused\" on coronavirus and the economic fallout. \"But climate change can't be forgotten this election,\" he said. \"The Covid crisis has shown us countries can do remarkable things in short order when they believe they have to.

            "The coronavirus has transformed everyday life so significantly that the effects are already visible from space. In China, where hundreds of millions of people were quarantined to help stop the spread of the disease, before-and-after satellite photos show pollution disappearing as work came to a standstill. In the U.S., as the number of coronavirus cases has grown quickly, companies are asking employees to work from home and canceling conferences. Schools are canceling classes. In Italy, another massive quarantine is underway. The changes have been sudden, driven by widespread recognition that it’s a public health emergency—and, although the window of opportunity may have already closed, a chance to prevent another deadly disease like the flu from becoming a permanent, ongoing problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "The scale of the response raises another question: What would it look like if the world responded to the climate crisis with a similar sense of urgency? The coronavirus response might not have been as fast as it should have been; if the Chinese government had acted faster, the virus might not have spread to other countries. And the Chinese government’s authoritarian tactics shouldn’t—and couldn’t—be emulated in large parts of the rest of the world. But in countries around the world, governments and citizens have been quick to change daily habits. The same hasn’t happened for the climate crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We’ve seen that governments can act, and people can change their behavior, in a very short amount of time,” says May Boeve, executive director of the climate advocacy group 350.org. “And that’s exactly what the climate movement has been asking governments and people to do for years in the face of a different kind of threat—the climate crisis—and we don’t see commensurate action. On the one hand, it shows that it’s possible to do this, and it’s possible for this kind of mobilization of resources to take place in a short amount of time. In that sense, that’s encouraging. But we were never in doubt of that aspect.” Instead, she says, it was a question of whether there was political will for rapid change.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are similarities between the situations—in both cases, the scientific community is offering clear warnings about what to do. Both involve public health. Climate change is already killing people in extreme heat waves and other disasters; it’s also worsening food and water shortages and it will displace hundreds of millions of people. The same pollutants that contribute heavily to climate change also cause air pollution that kills millions of people each year. Diseases like malaria and dengue fever are likely to spread as mosquitoes move into new regions. And as with coronavirus, people living in areas with the fewest resources are being impacted most by climate change. “Climate change also affects the most vulnerable first and worst,” says Boeve. “So we see that pattern play out as well, and how this is unfolding and how the response is and is not responding to that inequity and impact.”\n",
            "\n",
            "If the world was responding to climate change like it’s responding to the coronavirus—the level of urgency that the science says is necessary—things would look dramatically different. “We would see a lot of different things happening all at the same time,” says Boeve.\n",
            "\n",
            "Governments would come up with the funds to build the infrastructure needed to fully roll out renewable energy. “It’s cheap enough and available, but the regulatory systems that would enable people everywhere to get clean energy would require massive government investment,” she says. “We would see these kinds of emergency packages that would get people off of the fossil fuel grid and onto a clean grid right away.”\n",
            "\n",
            "After wildfires and extreme floods, relief packages would acknowledge the role of climate. In cities, development rules would change to require low-carbon construction. Farms would shift to regenerative agriculture. Just as the airline industry is struggling because of the coronavirus, some industries would see real impacts. “We probably wouldn’t still have an oil and coal and gas industry that was thriving in our economy,” says Boeve. We would have to find ways to support the workers from those industries, as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s a whole bunch of different things, which could all happen quite quickly, because we do actually know what needs to happen,” she says. “And that’s the amazing thing. But the shift in which, and this is what’s so interesting about what’s unfolding with a public health emergency is that I think there’s a trust in the public health community to say, these are the measures we need you to put in place right now. They’re ready to go and policymakers are acting. And the same thing is true with climate change. We’ve got those policies, they’ve been drafted. They’ve been waiting to be enacted.”\n",
            "\n",
            "A growing number of cities and countries have formally declared a climate emergency. Some are acting more quickly than others. But the overall mobilization looks nothing like the response to the coronavirus. In part, that’s because climate change still seems like a somewhat distant problem, despite the growing number of climate-related disasters that happen every year. Another obvious challenge: In the climate crisis, powerful companies have a lot to lose if the world acts decisively, and with the virus, though many people are losing money, there’s no similarly massive opposition to trying to address the problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The entrenched power and staying with the status quo is what differentiates climate change from this particular crisis,” says Boeve. “That is something that a lot of people are working on, and that is changing. It’s becoming more and more hard politically to justify taking donations of fossil fuel companies, for example. That is starting to shift.”\n",

            "London/Rotterdam - Today, Unilever set out a new range of measures and commitments designed to improve the health of the planet by taking even more decisive action to fight climate change, and protect and regenerate nature, to preserve resources for future generations. Unilever will achieve Net Zero emissions from all our products by 2039. We will also empower, and work with, a new generation of farmers and smallholders, driving programmes to protect and restore forests, soil and biodiversity; and we will work with governments and other organisations to improve access to water for communities in water-stressed areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "To accelerate action, Unilever’s brands will collectively invest €1 billion in a new dedicated Climate & Nature Fund. This will be used over the next ten years to take meaningful and decisive action, with projects likely to include landscape restoration, reforestation, carbon sequestration, wildlife protection and water preservation. The new initiatives will build on the great work that is already underway, such as Ben & Jerry’s initiative to reduce GHG emissions from dairy farms; Seventh Generation advocating for clean energy for all; and Knorr supporting farmers to grow food more sustainably.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alan Jope, Unilever CEO, explains: “While the world is dealing with the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and grappling with serious issues of inequality, we can’t let ourselves forget that the climate crisis is still a threat to all of us. Climate change, nature degradation, biodiversity decline, water scarcity – all these issues are interconnected, and we must address them all simultaneously. In doing so, we must also recognise that the climate crisis is not only an environmental emergency; it also has a terrible impact on lives and livelihoods. We, therefore, have a responsibility to help tackle the crisis: as a business, and through direct action by our brands.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Our existing science-based targets are: to have no carbon emissions from our own operations, and to halve the GHG footprint of our products across the value chain, by 2030. In response to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, we are today additionally committing to net zero emissions from all our products by 2039 – from the sourcing of the materials we use, up to the point of sale of our products in the store.\n",
            "\n",
            "To achieve this goal 11 years ahead of the 2050 Paris Agreement deadline, we must work jointly with our partners across our value chain, to collectively drive lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions. We will, therefore, prioritise building partnerships with our suppliers who have set and committed to their own science-based targets.\n",
            "\n",
            "We believe that transparency about carbon footprint will be an accelerator in the global race to zero emissions, and it is our ambition to communicate the carbon footprint of every product we sell. To do this, we will set up a system for our suppliers to declare, on each invoice, the carbon footprint of the goods and services provided; and we will create partnerships with other businesses and organisations to standardise data collection, sharing and communication.\n",
            "\n",
            "The race to zero must be a collective effort, and business alone cannot drive the transition at the speed that is required. We call on all governments to set ambitious net-zero targets, as well as short term emissions reduction targets, supported with enabling policy frameworks such as carbon pricing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unilever has been leading the industry on sustainable sourcing practices for over a decade, and we are proud that 89% of our forest-related commodities are certified as sustainably sourced to globally recognised standards. However, to end deforestation, we must challenge ourselves to even higher standards. This means that we need to have visibility on exact sourcing locations, and no longer rely on the mass balance system, which does not allow for accurate verification of deforestation-free when sourcing derivatives of our commodities.\n",
            "\n",
            "We will achieve a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023. To do this, we will increase traceability and transparency by using emerging digital technologies – such as satellite monitoring, geolocation tracking and blockchain – accelerating smallholder inclusion and changing our approach to derivates sourcing.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are also committed to working with the industry, NGOs and governments, to look beyond forests, peatlands and tropical rainforests, and to protect other important areas of high conservation value and high carbon stock which are under threat of conversion to arable land, with potentially devastating impact on the natural habitats.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to continuing to drive sustainable sourcing and an end to deforestation, Unilever is setting out to help regenerate nature: increasing local biodiversity, restoring soil health, and preserving water conservation and access. To do this, we will empower a new generation of farmers and smallholders who are committed to protecting and regenerating their farm environment. Initiatives that we will drive include securing legal land rights, access to finance and financial inclusion, and development of restorative practices. This integrated approach will improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and give them leverage to drive the regeneration of nature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unilever is also introducing a pioneering Regenerative Agriculture Code for all our suppliers. The new code will build on our existing Sustainable Agriculture Code, which is widely recognised as being best-in-class in the industry, and it will include details on farming practices that help rebuild critical resources. As we have done in the past, we will make the Regenerative Agriculture Code available to any organisation that may find it useful – with the goal of driving change throughout the industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unilever will also step up direct efforts to preserve water. Already, 40% of the world's population is affected by water scarcity, and more than 2.1 billion people consume unsafe drinking water.1 We will implement water stewardship programmes for local communities in 100 locations by 2030. To do this, we will take the learnings from our Prabhat programme in India, which tackles water quality and supply risks around our factories. This programme takes a community approach to water management, and not only helps farmers across cropping seasons, but also addresses the basic human need for adequate and easy access to water. We will build a model for this water stewardship programme, and partner with key suppliers for them to also run similar programmes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unilever will also join the 2030 Water Resources Group, a multi-stakeholder platform hosted by the World Bank, to contribute to transformative change and building resilience in water management in key water-stressed markets, such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n",
            "\n",
            "To further protect water resources, we also aim to make our product formulations biodegradable by 2030, to minimise their impact on water and the aquatic ecosystems. Although some of the ingredients that we currently use have no viable biodegradable alternatives, we will work with partners to drive innovation and find solutions to help us reach our ambition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Marc Engel, Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer, explains: “Our collective responsibility in tackling the climate crisis is to drive an absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, not simply focus on offsetting – and we have the scale and determination to make it happen. But this is not enough. If we want to have a healthy planet long into the future, we must also look after nature: forests, soil biodiversity and water ecosystems. In most parts of the world, the economic and social inclusion of farmers and smallholders in sustainable agricultural production is the single most important driver of change for halting deforestation, restoring forests and helping regenerate nature. In the end, they are the stewards of the land. We must, therefore, empower and work with a new generation of farmers and smallholders in order to make a step change in regenerating nature.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Alan Jope concludes: “The planet is in crisis, and we must take decisive action to stop the damage, and to restore its health. Last year, we set out a plan to tackle perhaps the most visible environmental issue we have in the consumer goods industry: plastic packaging. We set ourselves new and stretching targets that include halving our use of virgin plastic, and helping collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell. While it’s critical to address the impact that our products have at the end of their life, it’s just as important to continue to look at the impact they have on the planet at the start of their life – in the sourcing of materials – as well as in their manufacture and transport. We will reduce the impact that our products and our operations have on the environment, and we will do our part to bring the planet back to health.”\n",

            "In the stakeholder dialog, Volkswagen regularly invites guests to an open exchange of opinions about sustainability issues. Participating this time is the former chair of the SPD (the Social Democratic Party of Germany), Andrea Nahles. In this interview, the former Labor Minister talks about the consequences of digitalization and about finding the right balance between climate protection and job security.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to a study by the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, by 2035 four million jobs will be lost due to digitalization alone. At the same time, 3.3 million new jobs will be created in areas such as IT. We are therefore in the middle of a massive structural transformation. In order to shape this transformation, qualifying for new jobs must become an integral part of the workplace. This is the central duty of companies, employees and politicians.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have to take this seriously. Not everyone who has been doing a good job for 20 years likes to hear that a new phase of learning is now beginning again. Some are open to this. But many people ask themselves: What will I be up against? That’s why I expect companies and politicians to be honest with people, and to be transparent about what digitalization and the transition to electric mobility will mean.\n",
            "\n",
            "They must prepare their employees for the changes. Companies should not wait until the structural transformation has taken place and their employees’ qualifications no longer match the requirements. I found good examples of further training being carried out in a timely manner during my two visits to the Volkswagen plants in Zwickau and Braunschweig. The whole Group can learn a lot from these.     (Note: In Zwickau, Volkswagen is qualifying 8,000 employees for the production of electric cars. In the Braunschweig branch of Volkswagen Group Components, the company has trained 400 employees for serial production of battery systems, with 100 more soon to follow.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Politics can mitigate income losses that occur during periods of further training. That is exactly what is intended by the Qualification Opportunity law. In addition, we need greater investment in infrastructure in order to secure the expansion of electric mobility, for example. When the new electric cars come onto the market, people have to know where they can find the nearest charging station. Otherwise, sales will not meet expectations, which would put many jobs in Germany at risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "My feeling is that everyone is now alert enough to do what is necessary, but we also have to act quickly. After 2008, Germany came through the crisis well, because politicians, companies and employees worked closely together. With measures such as the short-time work allowance, we acted more effectively than many other countries did. We can be pleased that industry still plays twice as important a role in Germany as in Great Britain or the USA. We now have to defend this strong role played by industry. To do this requires at least as much effort as during the financial crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "The shortage of skilled labor primarily concerns specific professions such as engineers and mechatronics engineers. On the other hand, many companies still have a lot of unskilled or partially skilled laborers. These are the people who will have problems because there will be a fall in demand for less qualified work. At the moment, people earn good money even without a professional qualification – but this is changing, because the competition is becoming tougher. It is for this group that further training opportunities are particularly important. It is not the case that we in Germany are running out of workplaces. But seven million jobs are changing. We need a qualification plan for Germany.\n",
            "\n",
            "Working on an extensive qualification plan goes far beyond a single company and has to be embraced by society. This is an important reason why I am participating in the stakeholder dialogue. In addition, I have observed for a long time that the confrontation between environmental and employment interests is becoming increasingly tough. People talk with one another a lot, but there is no growth in mutual understanding. The climate argument, in particular, is becoming increasingly implacable. This worries me. So I find the attempt to bring various groups together in order to understand the different perspectives all the more remarkable. The vast majority of people recognize that both job security and climate protection are justified. That’s why there has to be a path that both sides can take. I hope that the stakeholder dialogue will build bridges.    (Note: In the stakeholder dialogues, Volkswagen managers regularly exchange views with external stakeholders on sustainability issues. The stakeholders include representatives of business partners, suppliers, NGOs, science, research, politics, associations and the sustainable capital market. The focus is currently on the transformation of the automobile industry, social sustainability and employment effects.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Industrial production in Germany must be retained. Otherwise, it will migrate to regions in which far lower value is placed on climate protection than here. This would harm employees as much as the environment. That’s one side. On the other side, I understand critics who say that the automobile industry has put off facing this transition for far too long. But that is over. We have ambitious targets from the EU and ambitious goals on the part of companies. That’s why I think that, in 2020, we should put the disagreements behind us and consider what our next steps should be. We should neither undermine nor outpace the climate goals. The current regulations will be demanding enough. We have to move from the climate fight to implementation.\n",

            "\n",
            "A lot of things have been put into motion over the past few years. There are better opportunities for working from home. There is greater understanding if someone leaves the office early to pick their child up from the kindergarten. Despite this, there is still more talking than implementation. For example, part-time employees are clearly disadvantaged in terms of career opportunities and pay scales. Eighty percent of these are women, whose work is thus devalued. In view of the lack of skilled labor, too, companies should ask themselves how they should deal with the potential of women working part-time. Often, women would be prepared to work 25 or 30 hours instead of 20 hours per week. But in many cases, they are not even asked.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a mother working full-time, I had the feeling that you can’t talk openly about how difficult the situation is – how you are sometimes pushed to the limits of your capabilities. There are very few honest debates about this. You sense, though, that it is viewed as a weakness if you are not able to deliver a full performance. As a politician, I was always able to deliver a full performance. But we in Germany have not yet reached the point where we can say openly: I need a day for my child. In my position in the government, I tried to make other parents’ lives easier by considerably increasing the proportion of home-based work and of part-time managers in the ministry.\n",

            "I have often been asked, at the end of a talk on climate change, if the problem couldn’t be solved by shrinking the size of the US military—which, questioners will sometimes assert, is the world’s “number one carbon emitter.” A comprehensive new report from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, “Pentagon Fuel Use, Climate Change, and the Costs of War,” authored by Neta Crawford, a professor of political science at Boston University, helps provide an answer to that question, or rather a series of answers. What they add up to is the idea that the Pentagon can play an outsized part in the climate fight—but only in part by cutting the amount of energy it uses.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Pentagon does indeed use a lot of energy. Maintaining an enormous military machine produces about 59 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, which is more than most of the nations of the world—roughly the equivalent of a Denmark or a Sweden, two Bosnias, or five Cambodias. That’s because you mostly fight war by pouring gas into the tanks of… tanks. And airplanes, and ships, and trucks. As one might guess, fuel efficiency has not always been the highest concern of military planners—the sixty thousand Humvees still in the federal fleet average between four and eight miles to the gallon. For anything larger or more lethal, fuel is measured in gallons per mile. And, of course, the military operates a vast network of bases across the planet, all of which use power.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still—and this is very helpful in understanding the full dimension of our energy dilemma—this is not a particularly large share of the world’s, or even our nation’s, energy consumption. Crawford’s careful analysis shows that the Department of Defense consumes roughly a hundred million barrels of oil a year. The world runs through about a hundred million barrels of oil a day. Even though it’s the world’s largest institutional user of energy, the US military accounts, by Crawford’s figures, for barely 1 percent of America’s greenhouse gas emissions. A useful chart in one of the report’s appendixes shows that the military has, through all the peacetime and wars since 1975, produced fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the US as a whole produces in a single year. This number naturally goes up if you count the emissions from civilian military production, but in relative terms it remains counterintuitively small.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of this is valuable information to anyone trying to grasp the scale of the global warming problem. As giant a consumer as the Pentagon is, its use of energy pales next to that of the civilian population of some three-hundred million Americans—let alone that of a couple of billion humans wealthy enough to consume lots of fossil fuel. Imagine the vast stream of cars that enters and leaves any American city each rush hour and then multiply that by every day of the year. Picture the server farms required to stream every evening’s crop of Netflix shows, or the pulse of natural gas required to heat homes, or the mountains of coal needed to turn on the lights every evening in every home. Energy use is the result of a billion actions every minute of every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, the military has actually been doing a not-too-shabby job of driving down its emissions—they’ve dropped 50 percent or so since 1991. In part, this is because the huge waste caused by earlier infrastructure has gradually declined across the economy—LED lights, for instance, make everyone more efficient. In part, too, the military has particular reasons to take efficiency seriously. Crawford quotes the then Marine Corps general (and later Trump chew toy) James Mattis from congressional testimony in 2011:\n",
            "\n",
            "On the fuel, it is a significant Achilles heel for us when you have to haul the amounts of fuel that we have to haul around the battlefield for the generators and for the vehicles. We are working with DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], we are working with a number of civilian organizations to try and find solutions. There are efforts under way to make more expeditionary bases which would actually generate some of their own energy requirements using, for example, solar power. In many of these places, there is a lot of sunshine. If we can get expeditionary capability to capture that and then basically recharge our batteries. I mean, it is an amazingly complex effort to maintain the fuel lines. And it also gives the enemy an ability to choose the time and place of attacking us.\n",
            "\n",
            "In other words, solar panels would shorten supply lines, a goal of every army in history. Crawford is right, I think, to insist that reducing the carbon footprint of the US military would reduce the global warming threat, but also right not to claim that it would have any kind of decisive effect. Denmark, after all, could go dark tomorrow without materially altering the climate change outcome for the planet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the military’s focus on energy use is uniquely important for other reasons, some of which Crawford explores. One is that, since Congress and presidents afford it incredible spending largesse (by some measures the US spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined), it has the freedom to explore new technologies that end up transferring to civilian use. Radar produced microwave ovens; the need for easy communications gave us, at some remove, the Internet. And so on. This ability could be harnessed more directly to help us build the new technologies and connect them in the systems necessary for a renewable energy age. The military-industrial complex may not be the single best place to conduct R&D, but given current political realities, it is likely to be one of the few places where it’s actually possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond that, the military spends much of its time engaged in the exercise that the rest of American public and private life seems to strenuously avoid: thinking hard about the future, with an emphasis on what could go wrong. This realism about risk and threats already led, over several decades, to regular Pentagon reports that defied Washington’s official nonchalance about climate change. As the climate expert Peter Gleick noted in a recent study:\n",
            "\n",
            "It is vital to understand the history of U.S. intelligence and military assessments of the security implications of climate change. These assessments go back nearly four decades to the 1980s and since that time, hundreds of assessments of climate change, a massively growing body of literature on the impacts of human-caused climate change, and analyses from every U.S. defense, intelligence, and security agency have acknowledged the links between climate and security.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the first of these reports three decades ago, the military has tended to be direct in delivering bad news. As Naval War College experts told the Senate in 1990, “naval operations in the coming half century may be drastically affected by the impact of global climate change. For the Navy to be fully prepared for operations in this future climate environment, resources of both mind and money must be committed to the problem.” That commitment most recently produced a DoD report to Congress released in January that began, “the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) missions, operational plans, and installations.” Considering the general tenor of the Trump administration toward climate reality, this is a strong statement, but many noted that the DoD seemed to be pulling at least some punches in deference to the current administration. A congressional request for a list of bases likely to be affected by climate change went largely unanswered, for instance, and Democratic congressman and House Armed Services Committee chairman Adam Smith said: “The Department of Defense presented no specifics on what is required to ensure operational viability and mission resiliency, and failed to estimate the future costs associated with ensuring these installations remain viable.”\n",
            "\n",
            "If this reticence continues it will be a sadly missed opportunity, because the Pentagon, when it speaks frankly, has the potential to reach Americans who won’t listen to scientists. In 2013, for example, Admiral Samuel Locklear, the commander of Pacific forces, told reporters that climate change “is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen… that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.… People are surprised sometimes,” he added. “You have the real potential here in the not-too-distant future of nations displaced by rising sea level.” Indeed. For if the UN estimate of two hundred million to a billion climate refugees by the end of this century is anything close to correct, that poses the greatest threat imaginable to peace on the planet. Only consider how thoroughly a million migrants from the Syrian crisis discombobulated Western politics in this decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "The most hopeful thought, of course, is that a move by the Pentagon—and the broader society it might influence—to more sustainable energy supplies could not only reduce the risk of all-out climate chaos, but it could also remove the most persistent justification for an outsized US military: the protection of oil supplies in the Middle East. At a moment when the White House is on a hair-trigger over suspicions that Iran has been attacking oil tankers, the prospect of how much tensions would be reduced on a planet that ran on widely available sun and wind is more attractive than ever. Crawford writes, “as a consequence of spending less money on fuel and operations to provide secure access to petroleum, the US could, in the long run, decrease US military spending and reorient its economy to more economically productive activities.” It could also free us to spend fewer anxious nights worrying about the next war and the next heatwave.\n",

            "Recent findings bolster more than 10 years of research, confirming massive carbon storage in old-growth redwood forests and potential of younger, previously logged forests.\n",
            "\n",
            "San Francisco, Calif. (April 30, 2020) — Newly published research from Save the Redwoods League and Humboldt State University (HSU) confirms the exceptionally large role that redwood forests can play in California’s strategy to address climate change. The research demonstrates that old-growth coast redwood forests store more carbon per acre than any other forest type. Forests of giant sequoia, coast redwoods’ closest relative, come in second. The findings cap 11 years of research through the League’s Redwoods and Climate Change Initiative (RCCI), which has also revealed that younger second-growth coast redwood forests grow quickly enough to result in substantial carbon storage in a relatively short period. This makes a strong case for investing in the restoration of previously logged redwood forests.\n",
            "\n",
            "Seeking to understand how redwoods are responding to rising temperatures, hotter droughts, and other factors associated with climate change, Save the Redwoods League launched its ambitious research partnership with Humboldt State University in 2009. In the latest phase of the initiative, the team of scientists studied redwood forests throughout their geographic ranges and the growth rates of previously logged forests. These studies help establish management goals for redwoods in terms of tree height, biomass, carbon storage, wood production and biological diversity. This work helps to identify where coast redwood trees have the highest potential to recover their stature quickly in harvested forests; where environmental and climatic conditions limit growth; and where improved forest stewardship is essential to increase coast redwood and giant sequoia forests’ resilience to climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "To arrive at their most recent findings, published in the latest edition of Forest Ecology and Management, the RCCI team combined intensive measurements and tree ring sampling to develop formulas for accurately quantifying forest biomass and productivity. In this study, the team climbed and measured 114 redwood trees ranging from 59 feet to 380 feet tall and from 115 to 2,340 years old.\n",
            "\n",
            "“While the recent results improve our understanding of the carbon storage capacity of the state’s treasured old-growth forests, they also reveal that individual redwood trees can maintain high rates of productivity for well over 1,000 years,” said HSU Professor Steve Sillett, lead author of the studies and an expert on redwood forests. “Just as exciting is the fact that young redwood forests can accumulate biomass at rates even faster than old-growth stands—with trees surpassing 200 feet tall in less than a century. Our research shows that investing in redwoods’ restoration—in particular helping to set second-growth forests on the trajectory to old-growth characteristics—would have tangible carbon benefits.”\n",
            "\n",
            "These RCCI results are provided as policymakers in California and all over the world are exploring the potential of natural solutions to the climate change crisis, particularly the role forests play in storing carbon in their wood as they grow. California’s current strategy for meeting its ambitious goals for reducing global greenhouse gases identifies an important role for natural and working lands. In 2019, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also issued a special report on the outsized role that forest conservation and restoration can play in addressing climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We have long recognized how iconic the redwood forests are to California’s identity,” said Save the Redwoods League President and CEO Sam Hodder. “Now we know that these redwoods are also our allies in the fight against climate change. That gives us all the more reason to accelerate the pace and scale of our efforts to protect and restore young, recovering forests and set them on course to become the old-growth forests of the future.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Prior to industrial logging, California had more than 2 million acres of ancient redwoods, but now only about 113,000 acres of old-growth redwood forests remain, largely protected in parks and preserves. According to Sillett’s team, there can be up to 890 metric tons of carbon (1 metric ton = 2,205 pounds) stored per acre of old-growth redwood forest, which is the estimated equivalent of taking about 700 passenger vehicles off the road for a year.\n",
            "\n",
            "In place of all that lost old-growth forest now stand about 1.5 million acres of younger second-growth redwood forests. Most of these forests (1.1 million acres) are commercially managed, with the remainder in various degrees of conservation ownership. While these regrowing forests don’t match old-growth forests in terms of total biomass or carbon storage per acre, they grow extremely quickly and recover fire- and decay-resistant carbon storage capacity fast.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a study published last year, the RCCI team found that in 150 years, fast-growing second-growth redwood forests can accumulate 40 percent as much biomass and store 30 percent as much carbon as the original old-growth in their decay-resistant heartwood. Further, some redwood forests that were logged in the mid-1800s have already accumulated as much as 339 metric tons of carbon per acre—the equivalent of taking about 270 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. This level of carbon storage has profound implications when extended across 1.5 million acres of second-growth redwood forests.\n",
            "\n",
            "These results suggest that investments in actively restoring second-growth redwood forests will result in substantial carbon sequestration without having to wait several centuries for the benefits of old-growth forests. These numbers have important implications when considering the potential carbon storage capacity across hundreds of thousands—or even millions—of acres of protected old-growth and regenerating redwood forests.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It is critical to protect what remains of our ancient redwoods, restore the young recovering forests and make smart investments now in our nature-based solutions to climate change,” Hodder said. “In so doing, we will enhance the forests and parks that inspire and attract millions of visitors from around the globe. And we will demonstrate California’s leadership in building a more climate-resilient world.”\n",
            "\n",
            "There is still a lot more to learn about how climate change will affect redwoods in the long run. Research from the RCCI partnership thus far indicates that the trees themselves were largely resilient to the recent drought. In fact, individual coast redwoods and giant sequoia in most old-growth forests studied to date have actually experienced a growth surge since the mid-1900s. At the same time, emerging research has shown that climate change-related shifts in fire severity, drought and forest pests have begun to impact giant sequoia, indicating a need for continued study of these forests in coming decades.\n",

A court in the Hague had ruled in favor of some 900 Dutch citizens and a group known as the Urgenda Foundation, which had sued the Netherlands, demanding that the state reduce its greenhouse–gas emissions. Khan realized the courts could be a powerful tool to fight climate change and in the process mitigate what she calls “one of the biggest systemic threats” to international human rights. She moved to London and joined Urgenda, where she now provides legal assistance to people around the world who want to take their governments to court over inadequate climate policies. She says she hopes the cases draw attention to the actions governments need to take to reduce the use of fossil fuels and to show how ordinary people will be impacted by climate change. —Tara Law\n",

Page channeled her anger into a new documentary based on Waldron’s work (and sharing its title), which examines the health impacts of environmental racism and the resistance efforts of affected communities. In the film, Page returns to Nova Scotia and talks to women leading the charge to restore their communities. They band together, for example, to prevent a company from building a natural-gas storage facility that would harm the Shubenacadie River, and to fight for the cleanup of Boat Harbour, a former aquatic hub for the Pictou Landing First Nation polluted by wastewater from a nearby pulp mill. “The level of cruelty in what I witnessed, in what these individuals have lived with, is disturbing and horrific,” says Page. “These issues are life or death, literally.” —Mahita Gajanan\n",

Early victories include pushing some of the world’s biggest companies to disclose the risk climate change poses to their businesses. To extend her reach, Simpson helps lead Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative to engage in behind-the-scenes negotiations to demand the world’s 100 biggest greenhouse—gas emitters change their ways. It’s prompted companies like mining giant Glencore to cap coal production and oil-and-gas major Shell to commit to emission-reduction targets.

In it, he argues for essential steps we still can and must take to save ourselves and the planet. And he points out that in order to make political changes, scientists and activists don’t have to convince everyone of the seriousness of the threat—they just have to motivate what he calls “climate-sincere” policymakers to put new regulations in place, and fast. With decisive action, he argues, humans eliminated acid rain and ozone-killing chlorofluorocarbons, and we can do it again. But it means confronting persistent myths about climate change.

Replete with a 329-kilowatt solar array, a geothermal heating system, and a rain garden, the $16 million building runs on its own energy—and it’s open 24 hours a day, every day of the year. This may be the most sustainable police station the country has ever seen. And in a city dealing with severe flooding issues and stormwater overflows, the native vegetation planted in the station’s new retention basin helps keep the site’s water in place. This makes Mary Jo Bazely, a volunteer who gardens and plants trees for the Cincinnati Parks Foundation, very proud. “There’s more green now. The water’s staying on site. It’s been remediated,” says Bazely before listing off several of the station’s energy conservation features that community members like herself made sure were included—right down to the outlets in the police lockers where officers can charge their cell phones and walkie-talkies with power from the sun shining outside.\n",

The G20 was rigged together in 1999 as a way of providing the management of the world economy with a broader political base. The story goes that then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers tasked his deputy, Timothy Geithner, together with his German counterpart, Caio Koch-Weser, with compiling a list of candidate states. Going down a table of population and GDP, they ticked France and South Africa in, Nigeria and Spain out.

The notion of sovereignty, which treats states with populations counted in the thousands as the equals of China or India, may satisfy international lawyers but it flies in the face of real differences in capacities and power. The reason that the G20 may not be suitable for the next phase of climate policy is not that it excludes small countries but that it does not include the right big ones.

            "As a child, Kotchakorn Voraakhom liked to pry apart cracked pavement to let seedlings burst through Bangkok’s sprawl. Now, the landscape architect designs park-size cracks to help Southeast Asia’s megacities cope with climate change. Last year, her 11-acre project at Chulalongkorn University was Bangkok’s first new public park in 30 years and won awards for its innovative design, which adds much needed “green lungs” to a dense metropolis and absorbs and reuses excess water plaguing Thailand’s -capital—one of the locations most at risk from worsening storms, floods and sea-level rise. This year, she will open a 36-acre plot with the capability of storing more than 2.5 million gallons of water. Her social enterprise, the Porous City Network, champions green interventions like these “thirsty” parks, as well as urban farming, green roofs and canal restoration to help vulnerable communities in Southeast Asia adapt to the coming deluge. —Laignee Barron\n",

Now 25, Wang is CEO and co-founder of a Silicon Valley–based startup, BioCellection, that transforms the most commonly used and unrecyclable plastics into new materials using pioneering chemical technology. “[Plastics] are just natural compounds and natural carbons tied together in an unnatural way, and once you disrupt that, you can use those natural building blocks to make anything,” says Wang. “We can make a product from plastic garbage that’s not only useful in new products, but it is biodegradable and can break down.” The company’s pilot program with San Jose, Calif.’s waste-management facility has already received accolades from groups like the U.N. Environment Programme, and now Wang is setting her sights on other cities all over the world. —Suyin Haynes\n",

In 2017, the book Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming became a best seller. Wilkinson was the primary author. One of her guiding principles is the need to shift the climate-change discourse to “be more courageous and more emotionally intelligent,” she says, and the book is “about moving through what is hard and continuing to rise to the challenge.” Wilkinson recently co-hosted her own outdoor retreat, the Feminist Climate Renaissance, bringing together women from across sectors. “The climate crisis is also a leadership crisis,” she says, “and many women and girls are stepping in to fill that void and lead us forward … in a way that has not been the status quo in the climate movement.” —Suyin Haynes\n",

As she moved into business and advocacy, Wu learned fast, and her patient cajoling helped shepherd the rehabilitation of the world’s No. 2 economy from an environmental pariah to a champion of green issues on the global stage. It involved tact. While international institutions publicly scolded China for its belching factories and toxic waterways, Wu worked with officials behind the scenes to help infuse global standards into industry and urban planning. “For a long time we were ignored, marginalized, but now we’re pretty much mainstream,” says Wu. Now CEO of the Future Innovation Center, Wu continues to advise governments and corporations on sustainability strategy and the low-carbon economy. —Charlie Campbell\n",

This would say that the remaining state woodlands would become reserves or parks and not harvested. Well, that would mean that 13 percent of the forests in Massachusetts would not be available for timber. The howling has been unbelievable — “This is the end of the world!” And yet, today, the regulatory system is not controlling this adequately at all.\n",

For example, a warmer planet is already leading to an increase in the frequency of natural disasters and the corresponding claims in certain product lines, with such events projected to rise even further in the decades ahead. In addition, insurers are reassessing their risk models, especially their reliance on historical patterns, given the changing severity and frequency of climate-related events. And a large portion of assets in certain industries will become “stranded”—meaning that they will no longer have value or produce income, particularly if countries around the world adhere to the Paris Agreement.

            "Israel announced on Saturday that it is establishing full diplomatic relations with the relatively isolated Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the latest in a string of international deals designed to show Israel’s growing acceptance abroad. “The circle of recognition of Israel is widening,” said Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi. “The establishment of relations with the Kingdom of Bhutan will constitute a new stage in the deepening of Israel’s relations in Asia.” The agreement follows several years of secret contact between the two countries with the aim of establishing relations, according to a statement from Israel’s foreign ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the deal, tweeting that it is an “additional fruit of the peace agreements”. The accord between the two countries does not appear to be linked to the US-backed Abraham accords, in which four Arab countries have agreed to normalise relations with the Jewish state since August. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel was in contact with more countries to normalise relations. Bhutan is a relatively isolated country and only maintains diplomatic relations with around 53 countries, which does not include the US, UK or France, who only maintain informal contact via India. With a population of around 800,000 people, the Kingdom of Bhutan is wedged between neighbouring giants, China and India. They have long relied on the latter for guidance on foreign and defence policy. Ron Malka, the Israeli ambassador to India said he signed the agreement with his Bhutanese counterpart, Maj Gen Vestop Namgyel, on Saturday night, calling the agreement a “historic day”. The joint statement on the deal said the key areas of cooperation would include economic, technological and agricultural development. “The ties between the peoples through cultural exchanges and tourism would also be further enhanced,” the statement added. Bhutan was closed off to tourists until 1970 and still strictly limits entry to the country with a $250 daily fee per visitor in high season\n",

            "Authorities searching for a British woman who went missing while hiking in the Pyrenees are reportedly considering the possibility she has deliberately disappeared because her nomadic lifestyle was about to end. Esther Dingley and Dan Colegate had been travelling throughout Europe since 2014 and she was expected to return from a solo trek on December 2. The 37-year-old set out to hike from the Port de la Glere to the Port de Venasque, a trek which follows the border between France and Spain, according to local police. Captain Jean-Marc Bordinaro of France's Gendarmerie de Saint-Gaudens told The Times: \"Esther Dingley wanted to continue with her current way of life, journeys in a camper van and sporting activities including hiking, whilst Daniel Colegate seems a little tired of this nomadic life.\" He added: \"Did Esther Dingley want to go off on her own to live her life and organise her own disappearance? There is nothing enabling us to eliminate this working theory.\" A spokesman for missing persons charity LBT Global, which is assisting Mr Colegate, told The Times \"there is absolutely no suggestion that (Ms Dingley) was seeking 'another life\"'. Mr Colegate said in a Facebook post on December 1 that the \"prevailing opinion\" of authorities was Ms Dingley was not in the mountains following extensive searches. She is now listed as a national missing person in Spain and her case has been passed to \"a specialised judicial unit in France\", Mr Colegate added. \"As things stand tonight, Esther is now listed as a national missing persons case in Spain and the case has been passed to a specialised judicial unit in France. \"This means they will be looking at other options beyond a mountain accident.\" Mr Colegate said he was \"very grateful\" for the extensive efforts of rescue teams in Spain and France, which had utilised helicopters, dogs and a drone. \"While this is a terrifying development in many ways, I'm trying to focus on the fact that it leaves the door open that Esther might still come home,\" he said in the post. \"She was so utterly happy and joyful when we last spoke, I'd do anything to see her face and hold her right now.\" The couple, from Durham, started to travel after Mr Colegate had a serious health scare, and had been documenting their campervan adventures online. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesman has previously said its staff were \"supporting the family of a British woman reported missing in the Pyrenees and are in contact with the French and Spanish authorities\".\n",

            "Tehran summoned the German ambassador on Sunday for \"unacceptable interference in Iran’s internal affairs,\" after the European Union condemned the regime's execution of Ruhollah Zam, a prominent journalist. Mr Zam was executed on Saturday morning after he was convicted in June for “corruption on Earth”, a charge often used in cases involving espionage or attempts to overthrow Iran's government. His website and Telegram channel, AmadNews, had over a million followers and was one of Iran’s most popular online news outlets both inside the Islamic republic and among its diaspora. His anti-corruption work, according to the Iranian authorities, fomented violence during the 2017 anti-government protests. AmadNews spread timings for the protests and leaked embarrassing information about officials that directly challenged Iran’s government. The EU, which no longer has a delegation in Iran, is represented by the rotating member state holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU, which is currently Germany. In a statement after his execution on Saturday, the EU said: “The European Union condemns this act in the strongest terms and recalls once again its irrevocable opposition to the use of capital punishment under any circumstances.” Mr Zam, 47, had been exiled under refugee status in Paris and was reportedly tricked into travelling to Iraq by Iranian authorities last year, where he was then abducted and forced to return to Iran under mysterious circumstances. The French envoy is also expected to be summoned according to the semi-official Fars news agency, for “the meddling of his country’s officials in Iran’s judicial affairs.” \"This is a barbarous and unacceptable act,\" the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement after the execution, which also condemned the hanging as a \"grave blow\" to freedom of speech in Iran.\n",

This may be the most sustainable police station the country has ever seen. And in a city dealing with severe flooding issues and stormwater overflows, the native vegetation planted in the station’s new retention basin helps keep the site’s water in place. This makes Mary Jo Bazely, a volunteer who gardens and plants trees for the Cincinnati Parks Foundation, very proud. “There’s more green now. The water’s staying on site. It’s been remediated,” says Bazely before listing off several of the station’s energy conservation features that community members like herself made sure were included—right down to the outlets in the police lockers where officers can charge their cell phones and walkie-talkies with power from the sun shining outside.\n",

Going down a table of population and GDP, they ticked France and South Africa in, Nigeria and Spain out.

The notion of sovereignty, which treats states with populations counted in the thousands as the equals of China or India, may satisfy international lawyers but it flies in the face of real differences in capacities and power.

There are those who hold to the dream of the 1970s that renewable energy may ultimately usher in a new era of “soft,” decentralized energy, and politics to match. But even if that unlikely vision remains a goal, getting there requires an act of power—the dismantling of the bastions of fossil energy. They will not simply give way. Indeed, as has recently been pointed out by Jason Bordoff, the geopolitics of decarbonization will be complex and nonlinear. And this is where the United States comes in.\n",

We set ourselves new and stretching targets that include halving our use of virgin plastic, and helping collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell.

That’s because you mostly fight war by pouring gas into the tanks of… tanks. And airplanes, and ships, and trucks.

Crawford’s careful analysis shows that the Department of Defense consumes roughly a hundred million barrels of oil a year. The world runs through about a hundred million barrels of oil a day. Even though it’s the world’s largest institutional user of energy, the US military accounts, by Crawford’s figures, for barely 1 percent of America’s greenhouse gas emissions. A useful chart in one of the report’s appendixes shows that the military has, through all the peacetime and wars since 1975, produced fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the US as a whole produces in a single year. This number naturally goes up if you count the emissions from civilian military production, but in relative terms it remains counterintuitively small.\n",

One is that, since Congress and presidents afford it incredible spending largesse (by some measures the US spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined), it has the freedom to explore new technologies that end up transferring to civilian use. Radar produced microwave ovens; the need for easy communications gave us, at some remove, the Internet. And so on. This ability could be harnessed more directly to help us build the new technologies and connect them in the systems necessary for a renewable energy age.

As Naval War College experts told the Senate in 1990, “naval operations in the coming half century may be drastically affected by the impact of global climate change. For the Navy to be fully prepared for operations in this future climate environment, resources of both mind and money must be committed to the problem.” That commitment most recently produced a DoD report to Congress released in January that began, “the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) missions, operational plans, and installations.” Considering the general tenor of the Trump administration toward climate reality, this is a strong statement, but many noted that the DoD seemed to be pulling at least some punches in deference to the current administration. A congressional request for a list of bases likely to be affected by climate change went largely unanswered, for instance, and Democratic congressman and House Armed Services Committee chairman Adam Smith said: “The Department of Defense presented no specifics on what is required to ensure operational viability and mission resiliency, and failed to estimate the future costs associated with ensuring these installations remain viable.”\n",

At a moment when the White House is on a hair-trigger over suspicions that Iran has been attacking oil tankers, the prospect of how much tensions would be reduced on a planet that ran on widely available sun and wind is more attractive than ever. Crawford writes, “as a consequence of spending less money on fuel and operations to provide secure access to petroleum, the US could, in the long run, decrease US military spending and reorient its economy to more economically productive activities.” It could also free us to spend fewer anxious nights worrying about the next war and the next heatwave.\n",
